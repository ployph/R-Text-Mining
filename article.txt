OUR COMPANY
BACK IN ’95 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD ON A CRAZY TOUGH LITTLE ISLAND WE FELT IT WAS TIME TO GIVE THE DIRTY OLD BURGER A KIWI MAKEOVER, AND START MOVING THE WORLD’S FAVOURITE VICE OVER TO THE HEALTHIER SIDE OF LIFE
THE BURGERFUEL MISSION
TO PROVIDE THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN GOURMET BURGERS, INCORPORATING DELICIOUS, FRESH, NATURAL INGREDIENTS, IN AN ATMOSPHERE AS CHARGED AS THE FOOD.
DEATH BEFORE BAD BURGERS.

Because we believe that life is too short to eat bad burgers, we cook’ em and prepare’ em while you wait, to bring you a healthy, built fresh alternative in gourmet fast food. We’ve cooked and eaten a whole lot of burgers in our time to get them to taste as good as they do, but that’s ok with us, our stores are our temples and burgers are our religion.

We’re continually looking for the freshest, healthiest, most wholesome ingredients, free from artificial colours, flavours, preservatives, additives and GE modifications. That’s why we use 100% pure grass fed beef and hormone free chicken. We also offer gluten free, vegetarian, vegan and halal options on our menu, as well as monthly burger specials using different and unusual ingredients to provide variety and adventure to the world’s burger connoisseurs. It’s the BurgerFuel way.

While it’s mostly about the burgers, we’re into some other stuff too. Like saving the planet. That’s why we run an ongoing ‘enviro-mental’ and sustainability campaign - a lot of tree hugging has gone in to the design of our chip cups, doofers and burger bags.

We’re also into anything loud, fast or both, which is why we have a collection of fully customised classic cars in the garage… and speaking of fast and loud, we throw one hell of a party too. But it always comes back to one thing here at BurgerFuel.

OUR HISTORY
Sometimes you need to know where you’ve been to know where you want to go. Which is why we’re pretty damn proud of our roots – from the first store in Auckland, New Zealand in 1995, to the globally growing gourmet burger brand you know, love, obsess over (and sometimes even stalk on Instagram) today. 
1995

FIRST BURGERFUEL OPENS IN AUCKLAND
The year 1995, destined for yet–to-be-invented useless trivia websites was saved from anonymity when the first BurgerFuel store was launched by Burger Master, Dr Mason. 

With Mason at at the wheel, this concept store on Ponsonby Road introduced a gourmet burger with fresher and more natural ingredients, delivered in a high energy environment conjured up from the images of flames, internal combustion and the desire to fuel and fire the human engine.

The passion driving the products, people and promotions set BurgerFuel apart from anything else in the fast-casual food category, and still pave the way today. 
1997

SECOND BURGERFUEL STORE OPENS IN TAKAPUNA
Within two years, word spread rapidly about New Zealand’s newest gourmet burger and the doors opened to our second store in Takapuna, Auckland.

After booming trade and huge interest from the locals, Takapuna became the first franchised BurgerFuel store.
1999

WHAT CAN WE SAY?
Well in 1999, we partied like it was 1999 because it was 1999. We even managed to squeeze some work in there too, developing this ultramatic streamlined like grease lightning kitchen design that would get our burgers pumping on the stereo of your taste buds faster than ever before without compromising on quality, integrity or style.

That’s right, if there are points for style, we want to win them.


THIRD BURGERFUEL STORE OPENS AND THE WORLD DIDN'T END
With two stores already cranking and Parnell’s nightlife ready to take off, the newest restaurant to hit the rise was BurgerFuel’s third store.

BurgerFuel blessed the new millennium by installing a new custom engineered kitchen in Parnell. The new design was an instant success. Completely Y2K compliant, the new BurgerFuel kitchen had the ability to cook and deliver a Ford Freakout (or any other burger) to customers within a much faster timeframe, even during peak periods – a feat virtually unheard of in the gourmet segment. 
2001

BURGERFUEL STORES START POPPING UP ON AUCKLAND CITY'S FRINGE
With three corners of the city already hooked on the Kiwi burger icon, it was only a matter of time before BurgerFuel snapped up a site in the western end of the city, Mt Eden.

With the fourth BurgerFuel store and third franchise we were well on our way to engineering the ultimate burger. Customer experience, kitchen speed, service and recognition were top of the BurgerFuel list with focus of world domination clearly set in our future.
2002

THE ‘TRON’, NOT JUST A MOVIE FROM THE 80S
Seven years in the making - BurgerFuel store number five hits New Zealand shores in the mighty Waikato. Hamilton opens with the biggest dine-in / take-away BurgerFuel restaurant seen in the system. The furious burger machine blasted on to the scene, fitting for the town affectionately known as “Hamiltron”.
2003

BURGERFUEL GETS ITS WINGS
With healthy wholesome ingredients and more mouths eating their gourmet burgers, BurgerFuel caught the attention of Josef Roberts. Josef, having left behind the world of Red Bull, started his burger crusade as a shareholder and director with a strong focus on bringing good burgers to the masses through local and international expansion. With major success as the founder of Red Bull Australasia, Josef was ready to give BurgerFuel wings.
2004

BURGERFUEL GOES CRAZY WITH THE LOCALS AND POPS UP ALL OVER AUCKLAND
With four stores carving it up and Kiwi gourmet burgers making a great impression on the locals, demand to bring in more stores was met by the need for a healthier, convenient alternative in fast food.

Four stores broke their way into Auckland spreading from Manukau to Henderson, Botany Downs to Glenfield in under a year. Domination was in full force. It was a whole South Side, West Side, East Side, North Side story sort of thing.
2005

THE NORTH ISLAND INVASION
The accelerator was on and there was no chance of slowing down, record burger numbers were cranking, more addictive, handmade, fresh natural BurgerFuel aioli was flying out of the BurgerFuel kitchen than ever before.

BurgerFuel was making an impression on Kiwis who demanded more attention to the finest ingredients, freshest product range and an uncanny ability to personally customise any burger you wanted, to how you wanted it – long before this became a fancy marketing ploy – we just thought it made sense to give people what they wanted and how they wanted it.
2006

PACKING OUR BAGS AND CROSSING THE DITCH
Just like everything good, Australia heard about the new craze in New Zealand and had to claim a store for itself. We packed up our store, wrote out the ingredients list, pulled all the staff together and hauled ourselves across the ditch to Sydney, Australia to open the newest international flagship store; it saw us flying the Kiwi flag high in the land of the Aussies. Not surprisingly they lapped up our 100% Kiwi beef, batched brewed sauces and wide range of vege and vegan burgers.

Unlike the pavlova and the airplane, we have the documentation to prove that BurgerFuel was, in fact, proudly born first in the NZA (New Zealand – Aotearoa).
2007

WOULD YOU LIKE SHARES WITH THAT?
Mid 2007 BurgerFuel gave all its fans, staff and believers a little piece of their heart, successfully launching on to the New Zealand Alternative Stock Exchange (NZAX) in typical BurgerFuel fashion, or in other words unlike any other company before it. Shares were bought in store, online, with a burger (almost) and in just about any way you could possibly think of.
2008

DEATH BEFORE BAD BURGERS
We’re dead serious about making the best burgers in the world, “Death Before Bad Burgers” is even one of the company mottos. In 2008, BurgerFuel reached its highest heights or made it to ‘another level’ if you will, with our second two-level store. With it came one of New Zealand’s most beautiful and iconic views, along the lakefront of Taupo.
2009

HALAL, IS IT MEAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?
With New Zealand taking off and Australia cranking over, the wider world had its eyes set on all the commotion.

It took a single knock on the door to blow our quiet world out of the water of what was soon to be the biggest achievement for BurgerFuel – a new international territory, half a world away. Once the excitement and partying died down it was time to get to work. BurgerFuel officially got ready to open stores in the UAE by signing a Master Licence Agreement. The plan was to export 100% pure New Zealand grass-fed beef to the Middle East.
2010

MIDDLE EAST MEETS LITTLE BEASTY MEATS
It wasn’t long until the Saudi boys got a glimpse at what was about to be the world’s next biggest investment opportunity, we already knew we made bloody good burgers; we were just waiting till the rest of them did too.

After hundreds of burgers, long walks along the sand dunes and a beautiful courtship BurgerFuel had sold the master licence rights to some good cats in Saudi Arabia. Our first official international store to open outside the South Pacific was Al Khobar, a 200 seater burger behemoth in Saudi Arabia in February 2010. Yeah, that’s right, those guys were so keen they even beat the guys in Dubai to the first Middle Eastern store.

With the ever evolving brand being lapped up more than anyone could ever imagine, the first food court style store was developed in Dubai Mall, where burgers are still made to order, when you order – allowing for the same fresh, char grilled goodness that everyone has grown to love.

Things didn’t stop here. In New Zealand we built a BurgerFuel on wheels, the Optimus Prime Beef of racing trailers with a mobile BurgerFuel kitchen – truly bringing BurgerFuel to the people. The BurgerFuel Mobile unit rolled on in to some of New Zealand’s most iconic events such as the Big Day Out, Parachute, Puma Social and Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix.


FAST CARS, FAST FOOD AND FASTER SERVICE
With the development of the iconic brand hitting the shores of the Middle East innovation was the key leader in making BurgerFuel the step above the rest. New store designs were rolled out with more dine-in friendly features like beer and table service being introduced into some stores.

The Middle East thrived on the same Kiwi concept, burgers, menu offerings and amplified environment. BurgerFuel had stores opening in Malls all over the Middle East such as, Al Shatea Mall, Dubai Mall, Amwaj and Midriff City Centre.

THE FIRST BURGERFUEL ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT IS BUILT
BurgerFuel Athletic Department (B.A.D), an underground fitness programme done BurgerFuel style, was launched in the basement of BurgerFuel HQ in Auckland, New Zealand. The principles behind B.A.D were designed by credible industry leaders in the area of sport science and developed with genuine athletes.

Weekly and monthly training sessions were created for BurgerFuel staff, Franchisees and Friends of the Fuel, incorporating a mix of everything from raw sledge hammer, giant tractor tyre and battle rope exercises to kick boxing, strength and conditioning and high intensity Japanese 'Tabata' workouts. It doesn’t matter if your exercise mantra is ‘blood, sweat and tears’ or ‘food, sweat and beers’, B.A.D catered for all levels of fitness, from total beginners to those paleo-powered Crossfit types. 

RADIO BURGERFUEL IS BORN
Born of the desire to have our own BurgerFuel signature sounds playing in all our stores, we combined burgers and beats to create Radio BurgerFuel, our very own radio station.

Radio BurgerFuel was designed to broadcast live and ad free throughout the BurgerFuel network of stores all over the world, from New Zealand and Australia to Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Egypt. It was also made available online at www.radioburgerfuel.com for takeout listening at home, work, or your next house party.

The Radio BurgerFuel studio in Auckland was relocated in 2015 to the recently renovated BurgerFuel New Zealand Offices. This new designer ‘radio kitchen’ features a sound-proof studio, the latest Pioneer DJ set-up and state of the art broadcasting equipment.

2013 - BURGERFUEL OPENS WORLD'S FIRST GOURMET BURGER DRIVE-THRU
After securing the ultimate site on Jumeirah Road, one of Dubai’s most prestigious streets, and with over two years of development behind it, the first purpose-built BurgerFuel drive-thru opened in September of 2013, to serve the world’s best gourmet burgers to drivers in the car mad Middle East.

2014

BURGERFUEL OPENS ITS FIRST RESTAURANTS IN EGYPT AND KUWAIT
Well on the path to global burger domination, BurgerFuel set its sights on two new territories in the Middle East, opening restaurants in both Egypt and then Kuwait within six months of each other.

Both stores were opened with existing franchise partners, Wadi Degla and Al Kuwait Investments (AKI), respectively.

BURGERFUEL OPENS IN THE SOUTH ISLAND OF NEW ZEALAND
It was the one they’d all been waiting for – finally the good New Zealanders of the ol’ bottom island could get their very own BurgerFuel fix, without having to hop on a plane somewhere (like Christchurch resident Mark Anderson who took to trafficking burgers home on the plane from Auckland so he could get a BurgerFuel fix in his home town).

BurgerFuel Bush Inn in Christchurch opened after a long awaited campaign by dedicated Cantabrians to bring the BurgerFuel burger to the south. The store was the largest of its kind in New Zealand and set opening day sales records for the country.

BURGERFUEL WELCOMES AMERICAN INVESTORS
In the biggest news in BurgerFuel history, BurgerFuel Worldwide signed an agreement with US company, Franchise Brands, LLC, who will joined BFW as a shareholder and franchise advisor.  FB is was created in 2005 with the support and guidance of the founders of SUBWAY® restaurants, Fred DeLuca and Dr. Peter Buck, in order to invest in and offer guidance to small and mid-market companies with experienced management that are seeking to expand their  businesses. SUBWAY® restaurants is the largest single brand restaurant chain in the world with over 40,000 franchised stores in more than 100 countries.

BURGERFUEL OPENS IN THE USA
We knocked the bastard off – the doors of BurgerFuel Broad Ripple, Indianapolis swung open on 29th May 2017, hot off the back of the Indy 500. The first BurgerFuel store in the USA is a key milestone in the global journey of BurgerFuel so the BurgerFuel crew are pumped. The flagship restaurant is located on a large stand-alone site in thriving Broad Ripple, a suburb filled with bars, clubs, eateries as well as four large universities.

ENVIRO-MENTAL
THE BURGERFUEL POSITION ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS STARTED AT ITS INCEPTION IN 1995, WHEN SUMMERS WERE WARM ON THE GLOBE – NOT DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING.
The BurgerFuel position on social and environmental concerns started at its inception in 1995, when summers were warm on the globe – not due to global warming.  As part of our continuing “enviro-mental” and sustainability ethos, our packaging has been designed and manufactured to strict BurgerFuel specifications and requirements.

SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN SELECTING THE MATERIALS USED IN ALL OUR PACKAGING. A LOT OF TREE HUGGING WENT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE CHIP CUPS, SIDE CARTONS, DOOFERS AND BURGER BAGS.
After going through a Woodstock load of hippies, BurgerFuel finally developed some excellent recycled, recyclable and biodegradable packaging. We even made sure the ink is made from a natural vegetable oil base sourced from renewable resources, instead of the usual mineral oil solvent stuff. Even our aioli punnets are made from biodegradable corn starch.

We then did a little survey in our restaurants and asked people whether or not they’d only come to us if we were more environmentally friendly than the other guys. The survey results came back with a resounding “not really”. But we know and they know it’s the right thing to do.

In addition, where possible our frying oil used in our restaurants is collected after use, recycled and turned into Bio Diesel which is then used to power vehicles.

Subject to clause 25.9, a call may be reduced, revoked or postponed as the Directors may determine.25.2 Call Deemed Made: A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments.25.3 Joint Holders’ Liability: The joint holders of a Security shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.25.4 Interest: Subject to clause 25.9, if a sum called in respect of a Security is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate as the Directors (acting reasonably) may determine, but the Directors shall be at liberty to waive payments of that interest wholly or in part.25.5 Payment on Allotment: Any sum which by the terms of issue of a Security becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date shall for the purposes of this constitution be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the same becomes payable and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of this constitution as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if the sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.25.6 Proof of Holding: On the trial or hearing of any action for the recovery of any money due for any call it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the holder of the Security sued is entered in the Register of the Company as the holder or one of the holders of the Securities in respect of which such debt accrued, that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the records of the Company and that notice of such call was duly given to the holder sued in pursuance of this constitution; and it shall not be necessary to prove the appointment or qualification of the Directors who made such call nor any other matter whatsoever; and the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt.25.7 Directors’ Discretion to Differentiate: The Directors may on the issue of Securities differentiate between the holders as to the amounts to be paid and the times of any calls or payment.25.8 Payments in Advance: The Directors may if they think fit receive from any holder of Securities willing to advance the same all or any part of the money uncalled and unpaid upon any Securities held by that holder and upon all or any part of the money so advanced may (until the same would, but for the advance, become payable) pay interest at such rate as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the holder of Securities paying the sum in advance; but no holder shall be entitled as of right to any interest on any money so paid in advance and29

The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Securities comprised in any such transfer and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall such purchaser’s title to the Securities be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale. The remedy of any person aggrieved by the sale shall be in damages only and against the Company exclusively. If the certificate for forfeited Securities is not delivered up to the Company the Directors may issue a new certificate distinguishing it as they think fit from the certificate not delivered up.26.11 Restriction on Forfeiture: Equity Securities shall not be liable to forfeiture for the failure of persons entitled thereto (by transmission or otherwise) to submit evidence of title within a specified time.27 Lien on Securities27.1 Lien: The Company shall have a first and paramount lien upon all the Securities registered in the name of each holder of Securities whether solely or jointly with others and upon the proceeds of sale thereof, and on Distributions from time to time declared in respect of such Securities for:a. unpaid calls, instalments, or other amounts, and any interest payable on such amounts, relating to the specific Securities; andb. such amounts as the Company may be called upon to pay under any legislation in respect of the specific Securities,and for the purpose of giving better effect to the provisions of this clause each holder of Securities irrevocably appoints the Company and each officer of the Company as attorney for that holder authorising the Company to complete an assignment to the Company of any moneys owing by that holder under the provisions of this clause and each holder agrees to ratify and confirm any act carried out by the Company in that behalf.27.2 Sale of Securities Subject to Lien: The Company may sell in such manner as the Directors think fit any Securities on which the Company has a lien but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable nor until the expiration of 14 days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the Securities or the person entitled thereto by reason of his or her death or bankruptcy.31

As part of our continuing “enviro-mental” and sustainability ethos, our
packaging has been designed and manufactured to strict BurgerFuel specifications and requirements.SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN SELECTING THE MATERIALS USED IN ALL OUR PACKAGING. A LOT OF TREE HUGGING WENT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE CHIP CUPS, SIDE CARTONS, DOOFERS AND BURGER BAGS.After going through a Woodstock load of hippies, BurgerFuel finally developed some excellent recycled, recyclable and biodegradable packaging. We even made sure the ink is made from a natural vegetable oil base sourced from renewable resources, instead of the usual mineral oil solvent stuff. Even our aioli punnets are made from biodegradable corn starch.We then did a little survey in our restaurants and asked people whether or not they’d only come to us if we were more environmentally friendly than the other guys. The survey results came back with a resounding “not really”. But we know and they know it’s the right thing to do.In addition, where possible our frying oil used in our restaurants is collected after use, recycled and turned into Bio Diesel which is then used to power vehicles.FIND OUT ABOUT OUR ENVIRO-MENTAL AIOLI PUNNETS (/NZ/OUR-STORY/AIOLI-PUNNETS)
OUR HISTORYSometimes you need to know where you’ve been to know where you want to go. Which is why we’re pretty damn proud of our roots – from the first store in Auckland, New Zealand in 1995, to the globally growing gourmet burger brand you know, love, obsess over (and sometimes even stalk on Instagram) today.1995
 FIRST BURGERFUELOPENS IN AUCKLANDThe year 1995, destined for yet–to-be- invented useless trivia websites was saved from anonymity when the first BurgerFuel store was launched by BurgerMaster, Dr Mason.With Mason at at the wheel, this concept store on Ponsonby Road introduced a gourmet burger with fresher and more natural ingredients, delivered in a high energy environment conjured up from the images of flames, internal combustion and the desire to fuel and fire the human engine.The passion driving the products, people and promotions set BurgerFuel apart from anything else in the fast-casual foodcategory, and still pave the way today.1997
 SECOND BURGERFUEL STORE OPENS IN TAKAPUNAWithin two years, word spread rapidly about New Zealand’s newest gourmet burger and the doors opened to our second store in Takapuna, Auckland.After booming trade and huge interest from the locals, Takapuna became the first franchised BurgerFuel store.1999WHAT CAN WE SAY?Well in 1999, we partied like it was 1999 because it was 1999. We even managed to squeeze some work in there too, developing this ultramatic streamlined like grease lightning kitchen design that would get our burgers pumping on the stereo of your taste buds faster than ever before without compromising on quality, integrity or style.That’s right, if there are points for style, we want to win them.
  THIRD BURGERFUEL STORE OPENS AND THE WORLD DIDN'T ENDWith two stores already cranking and Parnell’s nightlife ready to take off, the newest restaurant to hit the rise was BurgerFuel’s third store.BurgerFuel blessed the new millennium by installing a new custom engineered kitchen in Parnell. The new design was an instant success. Completely Y2K compliant, the new BurgerFuel kitchen had the ability to cook and deliver a Ford Freakout (or any other burger) to customers within a much faster timeframe, even during peak periods – a feat virtually unheard of in thegourmet segment.
 2001BURGERFUEL STORES START POPPING UP ON AUCKLAND CITY'S FRINGEWith three corners of the city already hooked on the Kiwi burger icon, it was only a matter of time before BurgerFuel snapped up a site in the western end of the city, Mt Eden.With the fourth BurgerFuel store and third franchise we were well on our way to engineering the ultimate burger. Customer experience, kitchen speed, service and recognition were top of the BurgerFuel list with focus of world domination clearly set in our future.2002
 THE ‘TRON’, NOT JUST A MOVIE FROM THE 80SSeven years in the making - BurgerFuel store number five hits New Zealand shores in the mighty Waikato. Hamilton opens with the biggest dine-in / take-away BurgerFuel restaurant seen in the system. The furious burger machine blasted on to the scene, fitting for the town affectionately known as “Hamiltron”.2003BURGERFUEL GETSITS WINGSWith healthy wholesome ingredients and more mouths eating their gourmet burgers, BurgerFuel caught the attention of Josef Roberts. Josef, having left behind the world of Red Bull, started his burger crusade as a shareholder and director with a strong focus on bringing good burgers to the masses through local and international expansion. With major success as the founder of Red Bull Australasia, Josef was ready to give BurgerFuel wings.
 2004BURGERFUEL GOES CRAZY WITH THE LOCALS AND POPS UP ALL OVER AUCKLANDWith four stores carving it up and Kiwi gourmet burgers making a great impression on the locals, demand to bring in more stores was met by the need for a healthier, convenient alternative in fast food.Four stores broke their way into Auckland spreading from Manukau to Henderson, Botany Downs to Glenfield in under a year. Domination was in full force. It was a whole South Side, West Side, East Side, North Side story sort of thing.2005 
 THE NORTH ISLANDINVASIONThe accelerator was on and there was no chance of slowing down, record burger numbers were cranking, more addictive, handmade, fresh natural BurgerFuel aioli was flying out of the BurgerFuel kitchen than ever before.BurgerFuel was making an impression on Kiwis who demanded more attention to the finest ingredients, freshest product range and an uncanny ability to personally customise any burger you wanted, to how you wanted it – long before this became a fancy marketing ploy – we just thought it made sense to give people what they wanted and how they wanted it.2006
 PACKING OUR BAGS AND CROSSING THE DITCHJust like everything good, Australia heard about the new craze in New Zealand and had to claim a store for itself. We packed up our store, wrote out the ingredients list, pulled all the staff together and hauled ourselves across the ditch to Sydney, Australia to open the newest international flagship store; it saw us flying the Kiwi flag high in the land of the Aussies. Not surprisingly they lapped up our 100% Kiwi beef, batched brewed sauces and wide range of vege and vegan burgers.Unlike the pavlova and the airplane, we have the documentation to prove that BurgerFuel was, in fact, proudly born first in the NZA (New Zealand – Aotearoa).2007
 WOULD YOU LIKESHARES WITH THAT?Mid 2007 BurgerFuel gave all its fans, staff and believers a little piece of their heart, successfully launching on to the New Zealand Alternative Stock Exchange (NZAX) in typical BurgerFuel fashion, or in other words unlike any other company before it. Shares were bought in store, online, with a burger (almost) and in just about any way you could possibly think of.2008DEATH BEFORE BADBURGERSWe’re dead serious about making the best burgers in the world, “Death Before Bad Burgers” is even one of the company mottos. In 2008, BurgerFuel reached its highest heights or made it to ‘another level’ if you will, with our second two-level store. With it came one of New Zealand’s most beautiful and iconic views, along the lakefront of Taupo.2009
 HALAL, IS IT MEAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?With New Zealand taking off and Australia cranking over, the wider world had its eyes set on all the commotion.It took a single knock on the door to blow our quiet world out of the water of what was soon to be the biggest achievement for BurgerFuel – a new international territory, half a world away. Once the excitement and partying died down it was time to get to work. BurgerFuel officially got ready to open stores in the UAE by signing a Master Licence Agreement. The plan was to export 100% pure New Zealand grass-fed beef to the Middle East.2010
 MIDDLE EAST MEETS LITTLE BEASTY MEATSIt wasn’t long until the Saudi boys got a glimpse at what was about to be the world’s next biggest investment opportunity, we already knew we made bloody good burgers; we were just waiting till the rest of them did too.After hundreds of burgers, long walks along the sand dunes and a beautiful courtship BurgerFuel had sold the master licence rights to some good cats in Saudi Arabia. Our first official international store to open outside the South Pacific was Al Khobar, a 200 seater burger behemoth in Saudi Arabia in February 2010. Yeah, that’s right, those guys were so keen they even beat the guys in Dubai to the first Middle Eastern store. 
 ïWith the ever evolving brand being lapped up more than anyone could ever imagine, the first food court style store was developed in Dubai Mall, where burgers are still made to order, when you order – allowing for the same fresh, char grilled goodness that everyone has grown to love.Things didn’t stop here. In New Zealand webuilt a BurgerFuel on wheels, the Optimus   Prime Beef of racing trailers with a mobileBurgerFuel kitchen – truly bringing BurgerFuel to the people. The BurgerFuel Mobile unit rolled on in to some of New Zealand’s most iconic events such as the Big Day Out, Parachute, Puma Social and Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix.2012
 ï RADIO BURGERFUEL I BORNBorn of the desire to have our own BurgerFuesignature sounds playing in all our stores, w combined burgers and beats to create RadioBurgerFuel, our very own radio station.Radio BurgerFuel was designed to broadcast live and ad free throughout the BurgerFuel network of stores all over the world, from Ne Zealand and Australia to Dubai, Abu Dhabiand Egypt. It was also made available online at www.radioburgerfuel.com (https://www.burgerfuel.com/nz/world-of- burgerfuel/radio-burgerfuel) for takeout listening at home, work, or your next house party.The Radio BurgerFuel studio in Auckland wa relocated in 2015 to the recently renovated BurgerFuel New Zealand Offices. This newdesigner ‘radio kitchen’ features a sound- proof studio, the latest Pioneer DJ set-up and state of the art broadcasting equipment.   2013Sl ews
 2013 - BURGERFUEL OPENS WORLD'S FIRST GOURMET BURGER DRIVE- THRUAfter securing the ultimate site on Jumeirah Road, one of Dubai’s most prestigious streets, and with over two years of development behind it, the first purpose-built BurgerFuel drive-thru opened in September of 2013, to serve the world’s best gourmet burgers to drivers in the car mad Middle East.

 BURGERFUEL OPENSIN THE SOUTH ISLANDOF NEW ZEALANDIt was the one they’d all been waiting for – finally the good New Zealanders of the ol’ bottom island could get their very own BurgerFuel fix, without having to hop on aplane somewhere (like Christchurch residen Mark Anderson who took to trafficking burgers home on the plane from Auckland so he could get a BurgerFuel fix in his home town).BurgerFuel Bush Inn in Christchurch opened after a long awaited campaign by dedicated Cantabrians to bring the BurgerFuel burger tthe south. The store was the largest of its kin in New Zealand and set opening day salesrecords for the country.Check out the media release here (https://www.burgerfuel.com/nz/newsroomchristchurch-we-re-open).2017ï fuel- id-     ger /voto d/bur m

Added to this are several other qualities that we look for in the people who want to work with us.An affinity with food.We like to think that our franchise holders want to make our burgers not only for their high turnover/financial return, but because they love food and believe in the products they are preparing. Knowledge of food and a flair for food combining will help with your business and the development of the business as a whole. Our training systems will provide you with detailed knowledge of our food and hygiene standards and the BurgerFuel 'flavour'.  
 A hardworking and dedicated attitude.The business, whilst a proven formula, requires the continual attention of the franchisee.A customer service connection.We have a loyal customer base and it is our duty to cater to their needs. This is a primary focus.Organisational and management skills.These are a necessity - for the daily running of the shop and for dealing with staff and organising rosters.Flair and character.Just as our shops have an in-built atmosphere, we seek people who can transmit the same good feeling to our customers. People come to BurgerFuel for a reason, and part of that reason should be you!The desire to develop and innovate.The shop and menu require constant attention. In keeping with the whole concept it is expected that franchisees will appreciate these needs and implement what is required. The aesthetics of BurgerFuel should be understood and recognised as important to the whole BurgerFuel concept.Basic accounting and financial knowledge.To be able to undertake to run your own business a franchisee will ideally have some understanding of financial planning and control.Financial security.It is assumed that at least 60% of the business will be funded by assets and cash. Borrowings are not sufficient to fund a business.

UPDATED: BurgerFuel's Enviro-Mental EcoChairsBy IDEALOG, 18 Jun 2013    Update: The brown colour of BurgerFuel's new Eco Chairs mimics the recycled cardboard packaging associated with the brand. It was also selected to tie in with the rimu, ply tabletops and booth seating. The chairs are also easy to maintain and scratches can be easily removed.The priority behind the design was comfort. Easy stacking was not considered essential, but it has not been ruled out of future adjustments to the design.
  Original post: Over the past few months, burger-vendingsuperstar BurgerFuel has been getting a makeover; a move away from the fast and furious garage trappings to more restrained, earthier tones.One thing that hasn’t changed, is the fast (but not too fast) food chain’s commitment to its 'Enviro-Mental' responsibilities.Introducing the BurgerFuel ‘Eco Chair’; a completely recyclable chair made from 100 percent recycled medium density polyethylene, and a stainless steel base. The first 200 Eco Chairs manufactured were made from old kayaks and road barriers, and they are currently in 14 New Zealand stores, as well as some Middle Eastern stores. 
This is part of an overall refit that is being rolled out in all BurgerFuel branches, which has focused on creating a lighter, brighter and more comfortable environment. The first to receive the makeover and chairs was the Albany branch in Auckland.The introduction of the new chairs has allowed the burger joints to become far more flexible and accommodating for large groups of diners and patrons of all ages. It also aligns with their existing biodegradable packaging and “Enviro-Mental” ethos. The plastic component of the new chairs is expected to have a five-year lifespan, at which point they can be recycled again.A total of 500 Eco Chairs have been produced, so expect to be sitting on one soon.
                                 BURGERFUEL WORLDWIDE PRESS RELEASEWednesday, 14th June 2017BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LTD PRELIMINARY FULL YEAR RESULT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017OVERVIEW - FY17The Directors of BurgerFuel Worldwide (BFW) are pleased to present audited results for the 12 months to 31 March 2017.Group Operating Revenue increased by 9.9% to $22.3M. BurgerFuel Total (unaudited) System Sales are up 5.78% to $102M* for the 12 month period, a key milestone for the Group.(*Please note; taking foreign exchange rate movements’ into account, the adjusted total system sales growth on a year-on-year basis is 4.0% equalling $100M).Net Pro t after tax for the period was $888,948 representing an increase of 178% on last year.This result is particularly pleasing considering the costs associated with the annulment of the Franchise Brands relationship and the resulting expenditure that occurred in order for BFW to enter the USA on its own. It should, however, be noted that further costs for the support and opening of the USA store have occurred in the early months of FY18.The Group has no debt, and cash reserves of $6.4M.Our Group Operating Revenue increased by 9.9% on the same period last year. This revenue is largely comprised of long-term recurring royalties and sales. The 4.0% increase in BurgerFuel Total System Sales for the period is made up of both new and existing stores’ sales growth.We have added nine new restaurants between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 within New Zealand as well as in Iraq and Egypt (relocation). As at 31 March 2017 there were 86 BurgerFuel stores operating worldwide.BFW RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD 1 APRIL 2016 TO 31 MARCH 2017Operating Revenue* Operating Expenses**Net Pro t/(Loss) Before Tax Net Pro t/(Loss) After Tax* Revenue includes; Operating revenue and interest income.** Expenses include; Operating expenses, depreciation, amortisation and interest expense31 March 2017$000 22,343 (21,229)1,114 88931 March 2016$000 20,328 (21,374)(1,046) (1,144)  
TOTAL (UNAUDITED) SYSTEM SALES UP 4.0% TO $100M.AUSTRALASIAN REGIONSystem sales across New Zealand (54 restaurants) and Australia (5 restaurants) increased by 15%.In New Zealand, we continue to strengthen our growth position. BurgerFuel remains the largest gourmet burger chain in this market, and the third largest burger concept overall.As well as functioning as a highly successful business unit in its own right, the New Zealand business continues to act as an incubator and testing ground for the global business. Constant focus on operational excellence, the development of world class training technology and system development will all continue to bene t the global business.The three NZ-based company-owned stores have performed well, and we continue to see potential in this area. With strong cash reserves and no debt, the Group is well placed to facilitate further key BurgerFuel restaurant purchases, should opportunities arise that  t the BFW criteria for company-owned stores.While sales continue to grow year-on-year, the board notes that the market should expect store openings in New Zealand to slow down as this market approaches its full potential – especially in the North Island. BFW still sees the opportunity for further expansion in the South Island and this will be explored during FY18.While focus will remain on the protection and growth of the existing New Zealand business, BFW will continue in its exploration of diversi cation opportunities. The board will be considering all options for continued expansion within the New Zealand Market, both inside and outside the BurgerFuel brand.The Australian market remains di cult, and alongside an extremely competitive landscape, we continue to face high operating costs such as rent and labour.Sales and royalty income derived from Australia has seen a reduction in comparison to FY16, due to the reduced store numbers, and a move to sourcing locally produced products, rather than exporting from NZ. In the long term, this move will improve pro tability for the Group and the remaining franchised Australian stores.As we seek to explore new markets in new countries our strategy has always incorporated our ability to both open and if necessary close or re-locate locations if the need arises. In early FY18, the franchised Parramatta store in Sydney was closed due to a less than expected trading performance. This will have no material impact on BFW results.As previously communicated, we are aware that it will require signi cant time and investment to establish the brand to a pro table level in Australia. At this stage we will continue to operate in the Australian market but it remains under review and accordingly monthly performance will be closely monitored with view to our long term commitment to AustraliaMIDDLE EASTERN REGIONIn the Middle East, despite facing the ongoing e ects of low oil prices as well as economic and political unrest, we have seen signi cant growth in certain areas and continue to make progress in this market.As of the 31st March 2017, we now have a total of 27 BurgerFuel stores across the Middle East.Most notably, our business in Saudi Arabia has seen signi cant growth in sales in the last six months, and this can be largely attributed to the recent revitalisation of the Saudi economy as well as e orts to increase marketing activity in that region.The UAE, as a whole, is seeing a downturn in the retail sector and this has been re ected in our sales. We are also facing a densely populated competitor market, with over 55 burger concepts now competing. Despite these challenges, our business in the UAE continues to operate reasonably well, and Dubai remains a strong focus for us in the Middle Eastern region.
The largest problem facing all retail brands in Dubai is the continued upward movement of occupancy costs with retail rents rising obliviously against a slowdown in actual retail consumer spending. These out of proportion occupancy costs take the shine o  trading results and remove incentives to develop further. This is a trend that is occurring in nearly all developed world markets (including New Zealand) and can only lead to both the failure of some concepts as well as the increased ticket prices of all retail goods sold in store, including food.In Egypt, we relocated a store in September 2016. While we remain optimistic about this market, the reality is that due to ongoing political turmoil, store turnover is very low and this market will require close monitoring. Our partners continue to look for expansion opportunities in Egypt and have our support in this endeavour.In Iraq, where we have one store in Baghdad, sales are strong, and our partners are actively looking at expansion opportunities.In summary, while revenue is down for the MENA region, it continues to be a good contributor for us, despite heavy competition, regional unrest and the economic e ects of lower oil prices. We do caution the market every year that our outlook in any of these regions can change quickly due to the ongoing potential for volatility in the Middle East. As such, we will monitor all of these markets closelyTHE YEAR TO DATE AND GROUP OUTLOOK.Despite withdrawing from the collaboration agreement with Franchise Brands last year, in May 2017 we announced the opening of the  rst BurgerFuel store in the United States, located in Indianapolis. This is a 100% company owned and operated store.Although it is early days, the store is operating well, and the initial public reaction has been extremely positive. The focus is now on ensuring the continued growth of this store, monitoring performance closely and preparing for further expansion in the American market.Outside of the US, the group continues to protect and grow the existing business, as well as look for new expansion opportunities both inside and outside of the BurgerFuel brand.Despite signi cant investment into the USA, cash reserves have increased, and BFW is in a strong position, not only  nancially, but also from a management, resource and intellectual property perspective. This places the Group in good stead for both further expansion and diversi cation into new opportunities.The Board will be considering all options for the expansion of the Group both in New Zealand and internationally. In this regard and as always we will keep the market informed of any progress made.The Group has no debt, and as of 31st March 2017 had cash reserves of $6.4M.We would like to thank all our shareholders for their continued support, and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.Best regardsPeter Brook ChairmanFor further information please contact: Kate McGahan021 858 619 communications@burgerfuel.com www.burgerfuel.comJosef Roberts Group CEOBURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2014

THE FRANCHISEE A.K.A THE ULTIMATE BURGERFUEL FAN
Nothing sets BurgerFuel® apart from the rest more than our people do. Sure, we believe our burgers are better than everyone else’s, but we think it’s our people who really set us apart. Our franchisees are perhaps our biggest fans - they all loved BurgerFuel® so much that they bought their own franchises. They each add their own personality, passion and energy to the BurgerFuel organisation.                                                                                                                                                               
Burger Fuel customers won’t go anywhere else

When it comes to target marketing to young adults, few people know more about it than the radio stations. That’s why home-grown gourmet burger chain Burger Fuel made a smart move when they recruited Aaron Carson as marketing manager. Aaron comes to Burger Fuel after an eight-year tenure at radio station 95 bFM where he spent four years as sales and marketing manager and four as general manager. ‘As a result, I understand the needs, wants and tastes of people in Burger Fuel’s primary target market very well,’ says Aaron. 

Burger Fuel now has 15 restaurants around the country. ‘Only a few more North Island outlets are planned, so if you’re interested, contact us now - you may miss out if you wait too long,’ Aaron urges. The South Island has opportunities, too, and the franchise will take its amazing tastes and funky feel to the West Island in November when the first outlet opens in Sydney. Some of the newer outlets have been built in suburban areas because the Burger Fuel menu appeals to practically anyone who’s adventurous about trying new tastes. ‘That’s why you’ll find kangaroo, crocodile or emu on the menu now and again, ‘ grins Aaron. ‘You’ll always be able to order the old favourites, but we like to make sure our loyal customers have something new to try, too.’

Burger Fuel attracts loyalty. While the 18-35 age group is the core market, after 11 years many people have grown up with the brand. ‘We regard these people as a very important market,’ confirms Aaron. ‘They have kids of their own now who may try to drag them off to one of the international chains, but our brand loyalty is outstanding. Customers appreciate the quality ingredients, healthy options and freshly-made flavour of our products, and are loathe to settle for anything less.’

company strengths
Aaron was attracted to Burger Fuel initially because he saw it as a New Zealand operation carving its own way in a busy marketplace. ‘Once I started working here, I realised that not only was it highly successful but everyone is fired up with the same passion that drives the chain’s founder and managing director, Chris Mason.

‘There’s a lot of emphasis put on the selection of franchisees - you have to have the right personality and share the same goals,’ Aaron says. ‘Once you’ve demonstrated those qualities, you spend 8-10 full weeks learning how to run a restaurant the Burger Fuel way.’ Theory and practice are taught at the group’s purpose-built Burger School behind the company’s Ponsonby Road store in Auckland, where franchisees learn the company philosophy, its systems and style of food presentation. ‘Strong systems are essential for success in this business and if you follow them they will ensure you can operate a successful Burger Fuel restaurant,’ says Aaron. ‘Much time is also spent focusing the franchisee on the customer experience as this is a unique in-store involvement that builds loyalty and passion.’

The success of existing franchisees is reflected in another major advantage. ‘Our finance package means the bank will put up 40% of the required investment of $300-400,000. I mean, how strong does the bank think the franchise must be if it will come up with nearly half the money you need? It speaks for itself.’

The company has always been recognised for its off-beat and irreverent marketing promotions. ‘We aim to continue that tradition,’ promises Aaron. ‘Our market appreciates ideas that are innovative smart and edgy, and that gives us a real advantage over the bland big-budget marketing of the multi-nationals. We make our promotions work harder.’ While Aaron’s job is to get customers through the doors, he’s well aware that it’s the experience they then receive that determines whether they will come back and become loyal fans.

‘That’s why we put so much emphasis not just on training but on ongoing support too. Franchisees are in regular contact with the office, and we now have an increased support team of five people. Chris likes to stay in touch with operations himself, so franchisees have access to a huge amount of experience to help them run and grow their businesses.’

The opening of Burger Fuel’s first Australian store, in the Sydney suburb of Newtown, has proved a fascinating challenge. ‘Starting up in a new country means that you have to make new connections and revise your thinking on various things,’ Aaron admits. ‘It hasn’t been an easy project, even though the franchisees are company people from New Zealand, but the ideas that have already come out of it will benefit our franchisees here too. Eventually, we plan to have around 150 stores throughout New Zealand and Australia. With the growing trend towards healthy eating sweeping both countries, I’d say we’ll accomplish that goal well within our planned time frame.’

 Aaron thinks many people are just discovering what Burger Fuel has known all along - that fresh ingredients and cooking to order produces a better, healthier product. ‘It’s a trend the international chains are trying to adapt to, but it’s hard for them to do so. Just recently our team went to one place that claimed the food was prepared only when it was ordered but we were still served in 15 seconds,’ reports Aaron. ‘That’s great service, but it hardly suggests that the food was cooked to order. Burger Fuel fans are prepared to wait a little longer in order to get something that’s actually worth eating.’

BFW Analysis
Overview
The company listed on the NZAX market in July 2007. 

The offer was for up to 15m shares (25% of the total) at $1 each with a minimum of $8m sought in order to list. Investors received 1 option for every 5 shares they acquired. 

Founding Shareholders Chris Mason and Josef Roberts purchased shares from the public pool, on the same terms as all other applicants, to ensure the minimum subscription was met. 

BFW has four main areas of revenue: up-front franchise fees, on-going royalty fees, sales of certain proprietary goods and store income from company-owned stores.

Performance
This information was extracted from the half year report provided by Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited released on 14 June 2017: 
Burger Fuel Worldwide Ltd Preliminary Full Year Results for the 12 months ended 31st March 2017

Overview - FY17

The Directors of BurgerFuel Worldwide (BFW) are pleased to present audited results for the 12 months to 31 March 2017.

Group Operating Revenue increased by 9.9% to $22.3M. BurgerFuel Total (unaudited) System Sales are up 5.78% to $102M* for the 12 month period, a key milestone for the Group.

(*Please note; taking foreign exchange rate movements into account, the adjusted total system sales growth on a year-on-year basis is 4.0% equalling $100M).

Net Profit after tax for the period was $888,948 representing an increase of 178% on last year.

This result is particularly pleasing considering the costs associated with the annulment of the Franchise Brands relationship and the resulting expenditure that occurred in order for BFW to enter the USA on its own. It should, however, be noted that further costs for the support and opening of the USA store have occurred in the early months of FY18.

The Group has no debt, and cash reserves of $6.4M.

Our Group Operating Revenue increased by 9.9% on the same period last year. This revenue is largely comprised of long-term recurring royalties and sales. The 4.0% increase in BurgerFuel Total System Sales for the period is made up of both new and existing stores' sales growth.

We have added nine new restaurants between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 within New Zealand as well as in Iraq and Egypt (relocation). As at 31 March 2017 there were 86 BurgerFuel stores operating worldwide.

TOTAL (UNAUDITED) SYSTEM SALES UP 4.0% to $100M

Australasian Region

System sales across New Zealand (54 restaurants) and Australia (5 restaurants) increased by 15%.

In New Zealand, we continue to strengthen our growth position. BurgerFuel remains the largest gourmet burger chain in this market, and the third largest burger concept overall.

As well as functioning as a highly successful business unit in its own right, the New Zealand business continues to act as an incubator and testing ground for the global business. Constant focus on operational excellence, the development of world class training technology and system development will all continue to benefit the global business.

The three NZ-based company-owned stores have performed well, and we continue to see potential in this area. With strong cash reserves and no debt, the Group is well placed to facilitate further key BurgerFuel restaurant purchases, should opportunities arise that fit the BFW criteria for company-owned stores.

While sales continue to grow year-on-year, the board notes that the market should expect store openings in New Zealand to slow down as this market approaches its full potential - especially in the North Island. BFW still sees the opportunity for further expansion in the South Island and this will be explored during FY18.

While focus will remain on the protection and growth of the existing New Zealand business, BFW will continue in its exploration of diversification opportunities. The board will be considering all options for continued expansion within the New Zealand Market, both inside and outside the BurgerFuel brand.

The Australian market remains difficult, and alongside an extremely competitive landscape, we continue to face high operating costs such as rent and labour.

Sales and royalty income derived from Australia has seen a reduction in comparison to FY16, due to the reduced store numbers, and a move to sourcing locally produced products, rather than exporting from NZ. In the long term, this move will improve profitability for the Group and the remaining franchised Australian stores.

As we seek to explore new markets in new countries our strategy has always incorporated our ability to both open and if necessary close or re-locate locations if the need arises. In early FY18, the franchised Parramatta store in Sydney was closed due to a less than expected trading performance. This will have no material impact on BFW results.

As previously communicated, we are aware that it will require significant time and investment to establish the brand to a profitable level in Australia. At this stage we will continue to operate in the Australian market but it remains under review and accordingly monthly performance will be closely monitored with view to our long term commitment to Australia.

Middle Eastern Region

In the Middle East, despite facing the ongoing effects of low oil prices as well as economic and political unrest, we have seen significant growth in certain areas and continue to make progress in this market.

As of the 31st March 2017, we now have a total of 27 BurgerFuel stores across the Middle East.

Most notably, our business in Saudi Arabia has seen significant growth in sales in the last six months, and this can be largely attributed to the recent revitalisation of the Saudi economy as well as efforts to increase marketing activity in that region.

The UAE, as a whole, is seeing a downturn in the retail sector and this has been reflected in our sales. We are also facing a densely populated competitor market, with over 55 burger concepts now competing. Despite these challenges, our business in the UAE continues to operate reasonably well, and Dubai remains a strong focus for us in the Middle Eastern region.

The largest problem facing all retail brands in Dubai is the continued upward movement of occupancy costs with retail rents rising obliviously against a slowdown in actual retail consumer spending. These out of proportion occupancy costs take the shine off trading results and remove incentives to develop further. This is a trend that is occurring in nearly all developed world markets (including New Zealand) and can only lead to both the failure of some concepts as well as the increased ticket prices of all retail goods sold in store, including food.

In Egypt, we relocated a store in September 2016. While we remain optimistic about this market, the reality is that due to ongoing political turmoil, store turnover is very low and this market will require close monitoring. Our partners continue to look for expansion opportunities in Egypt and have our support in this endeavour.

In Iraq, where we have one store in Baghdad, sales are strong, and our partners are actively looking at expansion opportunities.

In summary, while revenue is down for the MENA region, it continues to be a good contributor for us, despite heavy competition, regional unrest and the economic effects of lower oil prices. We do caution the market every year that our outlook in any of these regions can change quickly due to the ongoing potential for volatility in the Middle East. As such, we will monitor all of these markets closely.

Subject to clause 25.9, a call may be reduced, revoked or postponed as the Directors may determine.25.2 Call Deemed Made: A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments.25.3 Joint Holders’ Liability: The joint holders of a Security shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.25.4 Interest: Subject to clause 25.9, if a sum called in respect of a Security is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate as the Directors (acting reasonably) may determine, but the Directors shall be at liberty to waive payments of that interest wholly or in part.25.5 Payment on Allotment: Any sum which by the terms of issue of a Security becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date shall for the purposes of this constitution be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the same becomes payable and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of this constitution as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if the sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.25.6 Proof of Holding: On the trial or hearing of any action for the recovery of any money due for any call it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the holder of the Security sued is entered in the Register of the Company as the holder or one of the holders of the Securities in respect of which such debt accrued, that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the records of the Company and that notice of such call was duly given to the holder sued in pursuance of this constitution; and it shall not be necessary to prove the appointment or qualification of the Directors who made such call nor any other matter whatsoever; and the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt.25.7 Directors’ Discretion to Differentiate: The Directors may on the issue of Securities differentiate between the holders as to the amounts to be paid and the times of any calls or payment.25.8 Payments in Advance: The Directors may if they think fit receive from any holder of Securities willing to advance the same all or any part of the money uncalled and unpaid upon any Securities held by that holder and upon all or any part of the money so advanced may (until the same would, but for the advance, become payable) pay interest at such rate as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the holder of Securities paying the sum in advance; but no holder shall be entitled as of right to any interest on any money so paid in advance and29

The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Securities comprised in any such transfer and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall such purchaser’s title to the Securities be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale. The remedy of any person aggrieved by the sale shall be in damages only and against the Company exclusively. If the certificate for forfeited Securities is not delivered up to the Company the Directors may issue a new certificate distinguishing it as they think fit from the certificate not delivered up.26.11 Restriction on Forfeiture: Equity Securities shall not be liable to forfeiture for the failure of persons entitled thereto (by transmission or otherwise) to submit evidence of title within a specified time.27 Lien on Securities27.1 Lien: The Company shall have a first and paramount lien upon all the Securities registered in the name of each holder of Securities whether solely or jointly with others and upon the proceeds of sale thereof, and on Distributions from time to time declared in respect of such Securities for:a. unpaid calls, instalments, or other amounts, and any interest payable on such amounts, relating to the specific Securities; andb. such amounts as the Company may be called upon to pay under any legislation in respect of the specific Securities,and for the purpose of giving better effect to the provisions of this clause each holder of Securities irrevocably appoints the Company and each officer of the Company as attorney for that holder authorising the Company to complete an assignment to the Company of any moneys owing by that holder under the provisions of this clause and each holder agrees to ratify and confirm any act carried out by the Company in that behalf.27.2 Sale of Securities Subject to Lien: The Company may sell in such manner as the Directors think fit any Securities on which the Company has a lien but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable nor until the expiration of 14 days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the Securities or the person entitled thereto by reason of his or her death or bankruptcy.31

Schedule 2 Security Holders’ MeetingsAll meetings of Security holders of the Company shall be conducted in accordance with the First Schedule to the Act, except where varied by the following provisions:1 Methods of Holding Meetings1.1 A meeting of Security holders may be held either:a. by a number of Security holders, who constitute a quorum, being assembled together at the place, date and time appointed for the meeting; orb. if determined by the Board, by means of audio, or audio and visual, communication by which all Security holders participating and constituting a quorum, can reasonably be expected to be able to hear each other simultaneously throughout the meeting.2 Powers Exercisable by Ordinary Resolution2.1 Unless otherwise specified in the Act or this constitution, a power or right of approvalreserved to Security holders may be exercised by an Ordinary Resolution.3 Meetings of Security holders3.1 Annual Meetings: The Company shall hold annual meetings of Security holders in accordance with section 120 of the Act.3.2 Special Meetings: All meetings of Security holders, other than annual meetings, shall be called special meetings.3.3 Calling of Special Meeting: A special meeting of Security holders entitled to vote on an issue:a. may be called by the Board at any time;b. shall be called by the Board on the written request of Security holders holding Shares carrying together not less than 5% of the voting rights entitled to be exercised on any of the questions to be considered at the meeting.3.4 Time and Place of Meetings: Each meeting of Security holders shall be held at such time and place as the Board appoints.3.5 Equity Security holders entitled to attend: Equity Security holders of all classes are entitled to attend meetings of Security holders and to receive copies of all notices, reports and financial statements issued generally to the holders of all Securities entitled to vote at meetings of Security holders but are not entitled to vote at any such meeting unless the terms of the relevant Equity Securities so provide.3.6 Meetings of Interest Groups: A meeting of the Security holders constituting an Interest Group may be called by the Board at any time.

Security were fully paid equivalent to the proportion which the amount paid (excluding amounts credited as paid) on that Security bears to the total amount paid and payable thereon (excluding amounts credited as paid and amounts paid in advance of calls).9.6 Vote of Overseas Protected Persons: A Security holder who is not living in New Zealand, and who is of unsound mind or in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having appropriate jurisdiction, may vote in respect of any Shares held by that Security holder, by his or her committee, manager, or other person of a similar nature appointed by that court, voting in person or by proxy.9.7 Declaration by Chairperson: A declaration by the chairperson of a meeting that a resolution is carried by the requisite majority is conclusive evidence of that fact unless a poll is demanded in accordance with clause 11.1.9.8 Chairperson’s Casting Vote: The chairperson of a meeting of Security holders is not entitled to a casting Vote.9.9 Joint Security Holders: Where two or more persons are registered as joint Security holders, the Vote of the person named first in the Share Register and voting on a matter must be accepted to the exclusion of the Votes of the other joint holders.10 Restrictions on Voting10.1 No Vote when Amount Owing on Security: A Security holder is not entitled to vote at any meeting of Security holders (including a meeting of an Interest Group) in respect of any Security if any amount is due and payable on that Security by the Security holder to the Company.10.2 Voting Restrictions: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this constitution or the NZAX Listing Rules, a person is not entitled to cast a Vote in favour of a resolution when that person is disqualified from doing so by virtue of the voting restrictions specified in the NZAX Listing Rules.10.3 Deadline for Challenge: Without prejudice to any remedy (other than those which take legal effect against the Company) which any holder of Securities may have against any disqualified person who casts a Vote at a meeting in breach of clause 10.2, no resolution of, or proceeding at, that meeting may be impugned on the basis of a breach of that clause. Any objection by a holder of Securities to the accuracy or completeness of any list of holders of Securities who are disqualified from voting on a resolution pursuant to clause 10.2, which has been supplied by the Company to the NZAX or to any holder of Equity Securities on request pursuant to the NZAX Listing Rules, shall be disregarded by the Company and the chairperson of the relevant meeting if it is notified to the Company later than one full Business Day before the time fixed for commencement of the meeting.11 Polls11.1 Right to Demand Poll: At a meeting of Security holders a poll may be demanded by:a. the chairperson; orb. not less than five Security holders having the right to vote at the meeting; orc. a Security holder or Security holders representing not less than 10% of the total voting rights of all Security holders having the right to vote at the meeting; or

Burgerfuel opens three new restaurants
COMPANY NEWS NewsWire published by MarketLine on 07 November 2016
Table of contents

Residents of three more neighbourhoods across the globe are celebrating the arrival of BurgerFuel, with restaurants opening in Giza in Egypt, Sydenham in Christchurch, and the Northern Auckland peninsula of Whangaparaoa, over the last month.

In mid-October, BurgerFuel Whangaparaoa, which is located on a key site in the centre of the thriving suburb, was warmly welcomed by locals, who no longer have to travel further afield to get their gourmet burger fix.

This was closely followed by the opening of a third BurgerFuel outlet for Egypt. Situated in the city of Giza, the restaurant has been opened near the popular Shooting Club facility in Dokki, a major attraction for both residents and visitors to the city.

Most recently, gourmet burger lovers in Christchurch are celebrating the arrival of the 6th BurgerFuel outlet for the city. The restaurant opened today and is located on iconic Colombo Street, in the central suburb of Sydenham.

The new Sydenham store sits on a prime site, in the very centre of the busy suburb that plays home to a well-established retail strip. Thousands of workers come into the area each day to work in the nearby industrial zone, joining a large community of local residents. The restaurant has been opened with existing BurgerFuel Franchisees, Daniel and Natasha Chima, who have opened three BurgerFuel restaurants in Christchurch in the last two years.

General Manager of BurgerFuel Australasia, Craig Notman, comments; “We opened our first BurgerFuel outlet in Christchurch in January 2014 and had an overwhelmingly great response. Now, almost three years down the track, high demand has seen us get to six restaurants across the city”.

Notman continues; “The success of our business can be best measured by the achievements of our franchisees, and it's awesome to see Daniel Chima open three stores in such quick succession. Helping our franchisees to grow their store portfolios and gain success in new locations is an important contributing factor in fuelling the expansion of the BurgerFuel system”

BurgerFuel CEO, Josef Roberts, finishes; “Whilst our international focus remains on America, we continue to drive the ongoing expansion of the Company, both here in New Zealand and offshore. It's great to see the demand for our stores continue in these markets, and to know that the brand is reaching even more people around the world every day”.

Who Are The Major Shareholders Of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (NZSE:BFW)?
 Ricardo Crouch  October 6, 2017
In this analysis, my focus will be on developing a perspective on Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited’s (NZSE:BFW) latest ownership structure, a less discussed, but important factor. A company’s ownership structure is often linked to its share performance in both the long- and short-term. The effect of an active institutional investor with a similar ownership as a passive pension-fund can be vastly different on a company’s corporate governance and accountability to shareholders. While this may be more interesting for long-term investors, short-term investors can also benefit by paying attention to when these institutions trade in order to take advantage of the heightened volatility. Therefore, it is beneficial for us to examine BFW’s ownership structure in more detail.

Check out our latest analysis for Burger Fuel Worldwide
NZSE:BFW Ownership Summary Oct 6th 17
NZSE:BFW Ownership Summary Oct 6th 17
Institutional Ownership

In BFW’s case, institutional ownership stands at 51.28%, significant enough to cause considerable price moves in the case of large institutional transactions, especially when there is a low level of public shares available on the market to trade. These moves, at least in the short-term, are generally observed in an institutional ownership mix comprising of active stock pickers, in particular levered hedge funds, which can cause large price swings. For BFW shareholders, the potential of this type of share price volatility shouldn’t be as concerning as hedge fund ownership is is not significant,indicating few chances of such sudden price moves. While that hardly seems concerning, I will explore further into BFW’s ownership type to find out how it can affect the company’s investment profile.
Insider Ownership

Another important group of shareholders are company insiders. Insider ownership has to do more with how the company is managed and less to do with the direct impact of the magnitude of shares trading on the market. BFW insiders hold a significant stake of 12.77% in the company. This level of insider ownership has been found to have a negative impact on companies with consistently low PE ratios (underperformers), while it has been positive in the case of high PE ratio firms (outperformers). It’s also interesting to learn what BFW insiders have been doing with their shareholdings lately. While insider buying is possibly a sign of a positive outlook for the company, selling doesn’t necessarily indicate a negative outlook as they may be selling to meet personal financial needs.
General Public Ownership

The general public holds a substantial 18.32% stake in BFW, making it a highly popular stock among retail investors. With this size of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in major company policies that affect shareholders returns, including executive remuneration and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to decline an acquisition or merger that may not improve profitability.
Private Company Ownership

Another important group of owners for potential investors in BFW are private companies that hold a stake of 17.64% in BFW. These are companies that are mainly invested due to their strategic interests or are incentivized by reaping capital gains on investments their shareholdings. With this size of ownership in BFW, this ownership class can affect the company’s business strategy. As a result, potential investors should further explore the company’s business relations with these companies and find out if they can affect shareholder returns in the long-term.
Final words

BFW has a significant level of institutional ownership, which often causes long bull and bear trends if the perceived value of the stock changes for these big-ticket investors. This will allow an investor to reduce the impact of non-fundamental factors, such as volatile block trading impact on their portfolio value. However, other important factors we must never forget to assess are the fundamentals. I recommend you take a look at our latest free analysis report on Burger Fuel Worldwide to see BFW’s fundamentals and whether it could be considered an undervalued opportunity.

How Does Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (NZSE:BFW)’s Prospect Stack Up Next To Its Consumer Sector Peers?
 Becky Mayes  October 22, 2017
Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (NZSE:BFW), a NZD$61.42M small-cap, operates in the consumer discretionary industry, whose performance is predominantly driven by consumer confidence, which is linked to employment and wage rates. Purchasing power is also a factor of interest rates and lending standards by financial institutions. These macro elements determine how fast, and how often, consumers buy leisure products. The leisure service sector is also undergoing significant structural shifts resulting from technology applications. Leisure companies are able to engage with its customers faster and easier through online and mobile channels, which has been a positive driver for the industry. Consumer discretionary analysts are forecasting for the entire industry, a positive double-digit growth of 13.77% in the upcoming year, and a massive growth of 32.09% over the next couple of years. Not surprisingly, this rate is more than double the growth rate of the NZ stock market as a whole. An interesting question to explore is whether we can we benefit from entering into the leisure sector right now. Today, I will analyse the industry outlook, and also determine whether BFW is a laggard or leader relative to its consumer discretionary sector peers.
Check out our latest analysis for Burger Fuel Worldwide
What’s the catalyst for BFW’s sector growth?

NZSE:BFW Growth In Earnings Oct 22nd 17
NZSE:BFW Growth In Earnings Oct 22nd 17
Rising competition for consumer attention from new activities such as online streaming and mobile games has forced traditional incumbents to adapt or fall behind. However, the leisure service industry as a whole has been expanding. In the past year, the industry delivered negative growth of -2.14%, underperforming the NZ market growth of 4.51%. Given the lack of analyst consensus in BFW’s outlook, we could potentially assume the stock’s growth rate broadly follows its leisure industry peers. This means it is an attractive growth stock relative to the wider NZ stock market.
Is BFW and the sector relatively cheap?

NZSE:BFW PE PEG Gauge Oct 22nd 17
NZSE:BFW PE PEG Gauge Oct 22nd 17
The leisure sector’s PE is currently hovering around 28x, above the broader NZ stock market PE of 14x. This means the industry, on average, is relatively overvalued compared to the wider market. However, the industry returned a lower 10.09% compared to the market’s 12.65%, which may be indicative of past headwinds. On the stock-level, BFW is trading at a higher PE ratio of 69x, making it more expensive than the average leisure stock. In terms of returns, BFW generated 6.74% in the past year, which is 3% below the leisure sector.
What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? Leisure stocks are currently expected to grow faster than the average stock on the index. This means if you’re overweight in this sector, your portfolio will be tilted towards high-growth. However, the sector is also relatively more expensive, which may be reflective of this high growth expectation. If you’re currently concentrated in leisure it may be worth revisiting your investment thesis for each stock.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on the leisure sector, you may have just missed the boat on high growth potential as the market seems to have well and truly priced it into these stocks. The sector is relatively more expensive than the rest of the market which makes it less attractive to enter into companies like BFW right now.

Does Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (NZSE:BFW) Pay Its CEO Enough To Remain Motivated?
 Kelly Murphy  September 21, 2017
Josef Roberts took the helm as Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited’s (NZSE:BFW) CEO and has earned $550,000 in total compensation over the past 12 months. It is believed that a strong indicator of alignment between executive management and shareholders occurs when the majority of the CEO’s compensation is stock-based. There’s confirmation in the market, with 60% of total compensation among S&P500 CEOs, on average, comprised of stock-based incentives. Although BFW is a small-cap company operating in New Zealand, and may not be directly comparable to their larger counterparts, this analysis is still useful in terms of helping us understand how the company’s CEO is incentivised, and the level of alignment with shareholders.

View our latest analysis for Burger Fuel Worldwide
In comparison, Roberts did not receive any stock-based incentive last year. This is sometimes the case when stock rewards are tied to company performance, and earnings came in lower than the board had expected. However, BFW’s management team made an impressive step towards the right direction for earnings. The company delivered positive earnings in the past year, having had a negative profit in the prior period. This makes it seem odd that its CEO did not receive any stock rewards. Unless Roberts is already a significant shareholder in the company, there is room for improvement for BFW’s CEO pay package to foster higher alignment with its shareholders. Another case that could raise red flags is a substantial difference in the growth rate of company earnings compared to executive earnings. For example, if earnings growth dropped by more than 20% while the CEO took home a pay rise of over 20%, there may be a problem with alignment between shareholders and insiders. Roberts received a 10.00% raise in his total compensation while BFW’s earnings moved from the negative territory into positives. This seems justified given management’s efforts in turning around the company and producing profits for shareholders.

NZSE:BFW CEO Compensation Sep 21st 17
What’s a reasonable CEO compensation?

Maximum CEO Comp = (0.5% * Net Income + 0.03% * Market Cap)
Executive compensation has been a controversial subject due to its historically non-transparent nature and the influence of executive management over the board, which is set up to uphold shareholders’ interests. Higher transparency resulting from new financial regulations have forced companies to disclose its executive remuneration structure in detail, offering investors some information around the appropriateness of this expense. Above is a simple equation I use to determine whether the compensation of S&P500 CEOs are paid at the appropriate level compared to the rest of the market. After inputting BFW’s variables into the equation, CEO compensation exceeds what I would expect to be a reasonable level. This is because, after I account for how much money BFW made last year, and how big the company is in terms of market cap, Roberts should be earning less compensation. BFW must have a good reason to be paying its CEO a sum of $550,000! Or else shareholders may be bearing the brunt of the cost.
Final words

Burger Fuel Worldwide’s CEO delivered an impressive turnaround in company earnings over the past year, changing the tides from negative earnings to positive profits for shareholders. However, our equation suggests that Roberts’s salary may be too high relative to other CEOs operating a company of similar size, generating similar profits. Although CEO remuneration can be a useful sign for the alignment between a company’s CEO and its performance, it is certainly not sufficient to base your investment decision solely on this factor. Now that you know to keep in mind CEO compensation when putting together your investment thesis, I recommend you take a look at our latest free analysis report on Burger Fuel Worldwide to see BFW’s fundamentals and whether it could be considered an undervalued opportunity.

AMPING UP IN-STORETHE BURGERFUEL ATMOSPHERE   About BurgerFuel• Founded in NZ in 1995• Listed on the NZX in 2007• Global gourmet burger concept serving fresh, wholesome, natural burgers in a full-throttle atmosphere• Restaurants in NZ, Australia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq – with expansion plans for the USA and beyond Since the  rst BurgerFuel restaurant opened in 1995, it’s become legendary for creating fresh, wholesome gourmet burgers. And it’s equally famousfor its unique customer experience. Embracing vintage cars, graf ti art and cool music, the in-store vibe is always energetic, fun and memorable.It’s helped make BurgerFuel hugely successful,and the brand’s now found in six countries with80 stores worldwide. Music has always been at the heart of the BurgerFuel culture. “Every party hasto start somewhere,” BurgerFuel Marketing Manager Alexis Lam says. “We want BurgerFuel to be that place – where people meet and hear great music, setting the tone for the rest of the night.”And these days, Radio BurgerFuel is its source. Or more speci cally DJ’s manning the decks at the company’s custom-built Auckland based HQ, with both pre- recorded and live shows transmitted to restaurants in New Zealand, Australia and the Middle East.Fundamentally this innovative concept is an internet based radio station designed to completely reimagine the customer experience. As Spark Client Manager Darren Porter explains, the idea was born out if the need to standardise the in-store atmosphere across every franchise, both locally and internationally. “You’d rock out to Henderson, they’d be playinga certain type of music, then you’d go to Mairaingi Bay and there’d be a style of music played out there. So it was about making a consistent experience right across, and that was the brief.” And it’s all been achieved thanks to the Secure Business Internet solution and high-speed  bre network Spark provides.Thanks to  bre from Spark sparkdigital.co.nz
Fibre – the perfect  tSean Munden Monro, Chief Information Of cer at BurgerFuel Worldwide says when the company  rst looked into streaming live radio several years ago, the technology wasn’t affordable. But this quickly changed.“We looked into podcasts, a WAN and other network models, but  bre was ideal. The price had come down substantially since we’d  rst looked at it. So it was the best and most logical choice.”As well as needing speed and capacity for live music, the dependability of the Spark  bre offering also gave the company reassurance that broadcasting wouldn’t be interrupted, no matter how heavy the internet traf c. To ensure this, all stores were upgraded with large data broadband connections and the right kit to provide stereo broadcasting on site.Munden Monro agrees that reliability, resilience and scalability are crucial to Radio BurgerFuel. “The network needed enough power not only to stream music 24/7, but also to eventually expand that into our stores in other parts of the world. With  bre it’s fully scaleable – we’ve got enough capacity to do whatever we want.”Spark Fibre Bene tsFaster PerformanceImproves upload and download speeds, saving timeScalable OptionsMeets any size and budgetIdeal for cloud computingGiving you a better way to store and use dataConsistent performanceEspecially at peak timesReliabilityComplimented by technical support 24/7FutureproofEnsures you’re systems are ready for upcoming web innovationsIf you’re ready to create better connections for your customers, speak to your Client Manager or call us on:           “ We’ve gotten to the point where the sun never sets in the BurgerFuel world, so why should the music stop?”Alexis LamBurgerFuel Marketing ManagerFresh sounds, fresh opportunitiesNow with  bre in most stores, BurgerFuel is not only streaming live radio, it's also streaming live from outlets. This means guest DJsfrom any store can take the helm, plus bands can play live from any of their restaurants to the rest of the world. This opens up additional experiential opportunities for BurgerFuel, like the ability to broadcast live events and competitions.The music being played is truly up-to-the-minute. Obviously it would have been easy to just stream pre-recorded mixes but that simply wasn’t BurgerFuel’s style, according to Alexis Lam. “Our customers will recognise the difference between a crafted playlist and ‘auto-shuf e’. We want to surprise them every now and then with something new or different too. So we wanted to work with the music industry to get the latest sounds possible, and we wanted that ability to do it live.”Taking their sounds to the worldNow Radio BurgerFuel is becoming an important part of some ambitious plans. It’s essential for the BurgerFuel brand to be as unique as possible to gain cut through as they expand internationally. Witha little help from the Spark  bre network, Radio BurgerFuel is able to deliver the distinctive BurgerFuel sound and customer experience to burger and music lovers everywhere.“We’re a global brand, but our New Zealand origins are an important part of our identity,” Alexis concludes. “Radio BurgerFuel is helping channel the culture and authenticity that’s at the heart of our brand, to our customers all over the world”.A POS solu on suppor ng worldwide opera ons, with centralized configura on and repor ng.The BurgerFuel story began on Auckland’s Ponsonby Road in 1995, with a mo o that the brand s ll lives and breathes by today –‘Life’s too short to eat bad burgers’.

It’s what they like to call ‘Fuel for the Human Engine’.BurgerFuel doesn’t stop at just serving up the healthiest gourmet burgers possible, however - they’re also on a quest to save the planet, and are dedicated to their on-going ‘environ-mental’ and sustainability campaign to ensure their packing has low-to-no impact, and their ingredients are grown and produced sustainably and ethically. solu on overviewIndustry:Quick Service Restaurant Fast Casual DiningPOS So ware:PAR PixelPoint® HO EnterprisePOS Hardware:7200’sPAR cash drawers, PAR printersInstalla on Services:BurgerFuel IT Team (NZ) PAR Services (AUS) Channel Partners(UAE, Saudi, Iraq, Egypt)Maintenance Services:PAR Services, On-site, PS, SWM

 A milestone for New Zealand franchisingSimon Lord looks at how BurgerFuel attracted prime investment from the US and what it means for franchising here.The recent news that a US company. Franchise Brands, has taken a stake in the New Zealand-founded BurgerFuel marks something of a coming-of-age for the franchise sector in this country.The news is significant for severalreasons. First, because Franchise Brands has enormous credibility, having been created by the founders of Subway (the world's largest restaurant franchise) as a vehicle for investing in other up-and-coming franchise brands. This will give BurgerFuel access to, and leverage in, the world's leading franchise market. Cracking the US is the Holy Grail for any franchisor; with this deal, BurgerFuel has put itself in a great position to do exactly that.The second reason is that, perhaps for the first time, a New Zealand-founded franchise has attracted significant investment from overseas, not just in regional rights butIn the franchise company itself. Yes, there have been plenty of examples of Australian companies buying up New Zealand franchises to gain immediate traction inthe market here, or to acquire a proven system that will help them fill a gap in their franchise portfolio across the Tasman - but the BurgerFuel deal is different in that it is the potential offered by the combinationof a New Zealand-founded brand, image, product and operating system that has proved so attractive to the Americans.The third is that the deal comes onthe back of a brave decision to take the company public back in 2007 - a decision which, for the first few years at least, seemed to be not just an unnecessary complication but a financial disaster. In reality, however, it demonstrated a level of ambition and a level of financial probity that helped reassure potential licenseesin other countries and, ultimately, attract investment.A fourth reason is that, while mostNew Zealand franchisors think first of Australia as the logical place to expand overseas, after an initial foray BurgerFuel quickly saw beyond that. The Australian market is similar to our own and already had good, local brands occupying the space BurgerFuel had made its own in New Zealand. The franchise sector across the Tasman is also highly-competitive and highly-regulated. By targeting the Middle East, a region hungry for franchise brands, BurgerFuel put runs on the board and established its credibility in the financial markets and beyond.And finally, BurgerFuel founder Chris Mason didn't try to do it all himself- he built a team which brought the financial clout and experience to go first public then global, and the operational experience and credibility to make it work. Critically, this team included Josef Roberts - the man who turned Red Bull into a massive success throughout Australasia and understood the international potential of an edgy brand.He also understood how the financial world worked and, although he had made enough never to need to work again, had a massive ambition. As he told a local magazinein 2006, "To me as an entrepreneur you haven't really made it until you can builda global brand. Take a brand from New Zealand and make it global! If I could achieve that, I would feel that I've made a contribution to New Zealand and also to myself."The big pictureWhen news of the Franchise Brands deal broke, BurgerFuel's share price shot up, leading to a silly headline in the New Zealand Herald suggesting that Josef Roberts had made $30 million in a day- ignoring the many years of work and capital investment that had gone into getting the company to this point, including that expensive stock market float. It also ignored the fact that, if Franchise Brands chooses to exercise its option to increase its stake from the initial ten percent up to a possible 50 percent, both Josef Roberts and Chris Mason will be required to sell a large amount of stock at well below the market price.But it's not about short term gain. The big picture is that the deal with Franchise Brands will give BurgerFuel the local knowledge, the muscle, the experienceand, above all, the credibility, to exporta New Zealand burger brand to the USand beyond. Already they are talkingabout 1,000 stores over eight years. Ifthat happens, the value of even a reduced amount of BurgerFuel stock will increase - and all the carefully-calculated gambles will have paid off.Over the next few years, BurgerFuelwill undoubtedly go through more upsand downs and growing pains, but if it continues to set and achieve such big, hairy, audacious goals, it will have blazed a trail that other Kiwi franchisors will be keen to follow.Simon Lord is publisher of franf/i/je/VeivZeii/flnd magazine and website which provides information, advice, details of opportunities and advisors to franchisors and franchisees.

But the taste may bring you back, even at the slightly high price point.Offering Chicken Fenders ($5.90) instead of Chicken Fingers just meant, for us, disappointment over the grilled skin- less tenderloins that were still unexciting even with a hint of rosemary and garlic.

You won’t find fountain soda here, just Organic New Zealand Sodas ($3.20), of which I suggest avoiding the Lemony Lemonade, and fructose-free offerings from Boylan and Coke ($2.50).

On a busy day, there’s a good chance your too-tight table will be in the shadow of someone waiting in line at the counter and that you’ll be in proximity to a near-constant flow of staff delivering meals to tables and bussing tables as customers get water refills at the counter. Amid the hubbub, I found myself yearning for the relative calm of lunch- time at the downtown Steak n Shake.Food is served on trays along with doof- ers. What are doofers?

The device proved only mildly suc- cessful and was worthless once half the sandwich was devoured.
Whether a lazy dinner, a lunch splurge or a cheat meal, the blue and purple livery of the Burgerfuel brand has come to be synonymous with a mouth party for many Kiwis. And because something this good rarely stays in one place, it was only a matter of time before the company spread its wings and flapped abroad.There's a scene in Mad Men where Pete Campbell inserts death into a concept he's trying to sell a client. Rather unsurprisingly, the idea is promptly rejected and the brand representatives, visibly annoyed, make their way to the door, before Don Draper steps in and pitches an alternative idea that reminds everyone that advertising should always be of a sunny disposition and in no way related to death.
Despite this important lesson, which is well known in the industry, Kiwi-born Burgerfuel has at one point during its 20 year history done the unthinkable and chosen the motto 'Death before bad burgers' and ran a print campaign saying: 'What vegetarians kill for'.It takes a confident--some might even say cocky--brand to do this. But who would begrudge Burgerfuel the right to express a bit of overconfidence? The brand has, after all, gone from a solitary Auckland shop first opened in 1995 to now having 81 locations across six countries.As it has evolved into the multi-national franchise it is today, Burgerfuel has consistently maintained an irreverent marketing tone that leans on Americana and car culture, without extending into boganism. Combustion Tofu, Studnut Stilton, Unleaded Lamb and Chignition Pear were just some of the delights that featured on the first Bugerfuel menu. These options have come and gone, and only one has stood the test of time: the Bastard, a 1/3 pound behemoth that has been a prominent figure in its ads (Burgerfuel recently got a slap from the ASA for its Greedy Bastard billboard). Speaking of bastards, Burgerfuel was bold enough to put Pablo Escobar (and Kate Moss) on its 2007 White Christmas ad, which also featured the promise of 330 grams of Coke. It also took a jab at Donald Rumsfeld after his resignation and even named a novelty burger after him.Even when the company listed on the stock market in 2007, it didn't lose its sense of humour. A disembodied arm attached to a burger and a giant Burgerfuel skyscraper announced the move through a slightly insane poster.As 2008 rolled in, Burgerfuel expanded into the Middle East, setting up stories in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and has since also expanded into Egypt and Kuwait (it unfortunately had to close its Iraq operations due to the political troubles).But this story is far from over. Burgerfuel has also announced plans to move to Qatar, Libya, Lebanon and China. And given the success the company has already enjoyed in every country where it has a presence, we have no doubt Burgerfuel will have no difficulty spreading its Bastards--and death references--throughout those countries as well.Copyright of NZ Marketing Magazine is the property of Tangible Media Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

BurgerFuel facing 'lettuce crisis' a er wild weather destroys crops28 May, 2017 5:00am 2 minutes to readWind and rain have knocked out crops of our favourite greens. Photo / Supplied Herald on SundayFast food is the latest victim of the post-cyclone fresh veggie shortage with BurgerFuel having to pull its low-carb burger which replaces burger buns with lettuce leaves.The Kiwi burger chain has asked customers to bear with them while they overcome the "lettuce famine of 2017" that has le  them having to swap out iceberg lettuce for other greenery in their burgers at times."Our store sta  have worked hard to communicate this to our customers so they are not taken by surprise when their burger looks a little di erent to what they are used to," a BurgerFuel spokeswoman said.She said BurgerFuel was trying to maintain the integrity and flavour of their burgers given the changes and recommended customers go for a regular wholemeal or gluten free bun until they could again o er the lettuce-wrapped Low Carborator burger.  on

BUSINESSBREAKING NEWS:Police responding to a possible shooting at a house BurgerFuel Indianapolis: the verdict's in6 Jun, 2017 5:51pm 3 minutes to readAmerican fast food fans have started giving their verdict on the newly-opened Kiwi gourmet burger chain Burger Fuel, and they're largely positive. Photo / suppliedNZ HeraldAmerican fast food fans have started giving their verdict on the country's first BurgerFuel store - and it's largely positive.Social media site reddit was this week awash with reviews of the outlet, which last week opened its doors in Indianapolis.There was a comprehensive review from one reddit user who raved about BurgerFuel's motobites, but had mixed feelings about the burger."The burger was unique, like nothing I've ever eaten before. The flavour profile was extremely complex, and it changed with every bite," they said.However, "The burgers only come well-done. Admittedly, my buddy was more disappointed than me, but I prefer my burgers medium rare. The buns were also a little dry and a little over sized. The Lemony Lemonade was over $3. I get it, it's imported, but yikes."  on
One of the most enthusiastic reviews was from "bredec" who described the experience as "SO GOOD!""I was just complaining about the lack of Burger Fuels outside of NZ yesterday! I hope one pops up near us ... The veggie burgers (V-Dub & V-Twin) are seriously the best vegetarian burgers you will ever have. Even if you're not vegetarian, they're delicious. Also, kumara/sweet potato fries with aioli = yum."Another user complained that the meat tasted too processed."Much better than the cheap chains (McDonalds etc), but nothing gourmet either," they said.Another writer said they'd be back again."Price is pretty comparable to other burger places around - 5 Guys, Boogie Burger, etc. I thought the V-Twin was awesome. The plum and pomegranate sauce was delicious. The fries were nice and hearty ... almost steak cut like."For sure I'll try the kumara fries next time. The aioli was pretty good. My wife thought the single was nice and tasty. She said the tomato relish was a pleasant surprise."BurgerFuel had initially planned to open in partnership with Franchise Brands which owns Subway, but a er the death of Subway co-founder Fred de Luca in 2015, BurgerFuel chief executive Josef Roberts said the company decided to go it alone.Roberts previously told the Herald he was thrilled to be finally opening in the US."While it's been an epic challenge to open our first BurgerFuel store in the USA, we've done it," he said."Like any store we open, you never know how it's going to go until you swing the doors and start trading but we feel confident in the way that we have birthed the brand in the USA as well as all the resource and support we have provided for this historic opening."Roberts said the company had decided on Indianapolis a er thorough analysis, with the city boasting a catchment of about 65 million people within a three- to four-hour drive.The Midwest was also a good place to expand from.Trending in Business
BurgerFuel stays out of price war14 Dec, 2013 3:05pm 3 minutes to readBurgerFuel, which also operates 18 stores in the Middle East and one in Australia, reported a 35.4% increase in total system sales. NZ HeraldListed fast-food chain avoids discounts and boosts sales as rivals fight each other, says chiefBurgerFuel says its brand has proven resilient to a price war between major multi-national competitors such as Burger King and McDonald's in the New Zealand market.The NZAX-listed company, which also operates stores in the Middle East and Australia, yesterday reported a 35.4 per cent increase in total system sales, which includes sales by franchise stores, to $30 million for the six months to the end of September - a record for the half-year period.Net profit fell to $95,691 from $308,372 in the same period last year, with the operating revenue of the listed firm - what the franchisor earns from franchisees' royalties - up 25.5 per cent to $6.73 million.The company said the fall in profit was in line with previous market guidance and was a result of investing for future growth.  Co
Operating expenses li ed to $6.6 million from $4.9 million in the same period a year earlier."During the period we have prepared the business for major global growth opportunities, which we hope to announce to you shortly," BurgerFuel said.Chief executive Josef Roberts said BurgerFuel had not been dragged into the price war between its larger competitors. Amid an ultra-competitive fast food environment, McDonald's and Burger King have been o ering burgers for as little as $2."We've kept away from that [discounting] and we've grown sales strongly while all of that's been going on," Roberts said. "It's become apparent that we are positioned away from the multi-nationals."BurgerFuel said sales in New Zealand and Australia (the company runs only one store across the Tasman in Sydney) rose 19.4 per cent in the six months to September 30.The company will open its first South Island store in Christchurch next month.Related articles: LIFESTYLEMcDonald's sorry for trying to ban youths a er 7pm10 Jan, 2014 12:24pm 2 minutes to read In the Middle East, where BurgerFuel now has 18 restaurants, sales rose 74.1 per cent.Civil strife in Egypt had slowed the opening of two stores in that country's capital, Cairo.Roberts said construction of one of the stores had been completed, but the site was too close to one of the main "fighting areas" to open.But the other restaurant might be operational by the end of next month, he said.Egypt has experienced months of unrest since former President Mohammed Morsi was ousted by the military in July.Despite the troubles facing the North African country, Roberts said he still felt positive about the Egyptian market."The fighting is not going on all over the place - it's isolated areas and we think there's a market there for us," he said. "We'll get one store open, make sure everything's running right and then when things calm down we'll open the other one."

But this quickly changed.“We looked into podcasts, a WAN and other network models, but  bre was ideal. The price had come down substantially since we’d  rst looked at it. So it was the best and most logical choice.”As well as needing speed and capacity for live music, the dependability of the Spark  bre offering also gave the company reassurance that broadcasting wouldn’t be interrupted, no matter how heavy the internet traf c. To ensure this, all stores were upgraded with large data broadband connections and the right kit to provide stereo broadcasting on site.Munden Monro agrees that reliability, resilience and scalability are crucial to Radio BurgerFuel. “The network needed enough power not only to stream music 24/7, but also to eventually expand that into our stores in other parts of the world. With  bre it’s fully scaleable – we’ve got enough capacity to do whatever we want.”Spark Fibre Bene tsFaster PerformanceImproves upload and download speeds, saving timeScalable OptionsMeets any size and budgetIdeal for cloud computingGiving you a better way to store and use dataConsistent performanceEspecially at peak timesReliabilityComplimented by technical support 24/7FutureproofEnsures you’re systems are ready for upcoming web innovationsIf you’re ready to create better connections for your customers, speak to your Client Manager or call us on:           “ We’ve gotten to the point where the sun never sets in the BurgerFuel world, so why should the music stop?”Alexis LamBurgerFuel Marketing ManagerFresh sounds, fresh opportunitiesNow with  bre in most stores, BurgerFuel is not only streaming live radio, it's also streaming live from outlets. This means guest DJsfrom any store can take the helm, plus bands can play live from any of their restaurants to the rest of the world. This opens up additional experiential opportunities for BurgerFuel, like the ability to broadcast live events and competitions.The music being played is truly up-to-the-minute. Obviously it would have been easy to just stream pre-recorded mixes but that simply wasn’t BurgerFuel’s style, according to Alexis Lam. “Our customers will recognise the difference between a crafted playlist and ‘auto-shuf e’. We want to surprise them every now and then with something new or different too. So we wanted to work with the music industry to get the latest sounds possible, and we wanted that ability to do it live.”Taking their sounds to the worldNow Radio BurgerFuel is becoming an important part of some ambitious plans. It’s essential for the BurgerFuel brand to be as unique as possible to gain cut through as they expand internationally. Witha little help from the Spark  bre network, Radio BurgerFuel is able to deliver the distinctive BurgerFuel sound and customer experience to burger and music lovers everywhere.“We’re a global brand, but our New Zealand origins are an important part of our identity,” Alexis concludes. “Radio BurgerFuel is helping channel the culture and authenticity that’s at the heart of our brand, to
Burgers can be healthy, if you chose the right kindBurgers can have high fat content, but there's good stuff about them too.Thanks to fast food chains, burgers have a bad rap. They contain few or no vegetables, fatty, processed beef and processed cheese, sugar-laden sauces, and high-glycemic, white flour buns, often with a sugary glaze on them.Don't use this as an excuse to have burgers every night this week, but it's time we stop demonising the humble patty and bun combo. Burgers can be healthy, if you chose the right kind.That means stepping away from the fast food joint, and into either a gourmet burger shop, or your own kitchen.THE PROBLEMS WITH BURGERSLet's get one thing straight: burgers are not typically healthy. The cuts of beef used in your average patty are loaded with fat – around 25 grams of it, 10 of which are saturated. A burger such as a Big Mac comes in at 494 calories, half of which can be attributed to its fat content.READ MORE:* What are the best ways to make healthy choices at the supermarket? * How to eat a healthy dinner when feel like you don't have the time* Vegan or vegetarian: Which diet is better for your health?One serving of sauce on a burger will garner around 10 grams of sugar, too — that's more than your average chocolate biscuit. Most burger condiments such as barbecue and tomato sauce are at least a quarter sugar.Then there's the buns. Refined white flour that instantly gives your blood sugar levels a surge, and provides little nutrition. When combined with high- fat meat and high-sugar sauce, a burger is basically as bad for you as eating a huge slice of cake.THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNAccording to the US Geographical Survey, to raise a cow for a single hamburger a farmer will use between 15,000 and 68,000 litres of water.Ad FeedbackThe global demand for meat increases two per cent each year, and in New Zealand cattle and sheep livestock amounts to almost one-third of all greenhouse carbon emissions, according to the Ministry for the Environment.That makes cows our largest single contributor to climate change – more than keeping our cars on the roads – and means every burger you eat is another whack to the environment.THE UPSIDES OF THE STANDARD BURGERAll the fat, sugar, and carbs in the average burger aside, there are positives about it. Primarily, there's the protein content. In New Zealand, chains such as McDonald's and Burger King make their patties from 100 per cent beef (there are no fillers), meaning they are an excellent source of protein. There's a whopping 26.4 grams of protein in a Big Mac, for example.Red meat is also a dense source of iron. Your body will absorb as much as 35 per cent ofSUPPLIED heme iron from animal-based protein, whereas from plant-based protein it will only take in 20 per cent. A large beef patty will have around 4mg of iron per serve, which is half of what males need each day (women, however, need around 18of iron per day so a burger patty will provide less than a quarter of that).Vitamin B12 is also plentiful in a burger patty. Essential for production of new red blood cells, adults need 2.4mg of B12 a day and a burger provides you with nearly three milligrams. That means you can meet your daily requirement.CHOOSING A HEALTHIER BURGEROne of the big advantages of going to a gourmet burger shop (or making burgers at home) is the vegetable content of your meal. Unlike fast food chains which include just a sad bit of lettuce, slice of tomato, and a pickled gherkin, these restaurants stock your burger buns with healthy greens and veggies like onions, quality cheese, and can include high-value nutritional items such as avocado or beetroot.A burger patty made at home or bought from a gourmet burger store will be equal to or superior in protein as fast food beef, and may have less saturated fat if it's a leaner cut of meat. To avoid the fat issue altogether, you can chose an alternative meat such as chicken for your burger, or go vegetarian – lots of burger shops offer meat-free alternatives such as lentil, pumpkin, or chickpea-based patties.PASS ON THE SAUCE
Naturally, you'll need to pass on the sauce to make your burger healthy. Hopefully your patty is succulent enough on its own and doesn't need the extra lubrication that barbecue or another sauce provides.If you need a dressing, find out what is sugar-free on the menu. Anything yoghurt-based might do the trick. You can also hold off on the cheese to get your calorie content down.     BUN CHOICES 45Lastly there's that bun. Most people think it's not a burger without it, although many restaurants now offer "lettuce buns" which are an ideal way to eat a burger and make it really healthy.Failing that, chose a whole wheat/multigrain bun if available. Chains like BurgerFuel have buns made out of a mixture of wholemeal and hard wheat flour, have reduced salt, no added sugar, are blended with olive oil, and have no preservatives. It's still bread, but will be lower on the GI index.- Stuff

Photo / Michael CraigBy: Steve BrauniasSenior Writer, NZ Herald steve.braunias@nzherald.co.nz @SteveBrauniasSteve Braunias is on a mission to eat (and drink) at each one of the 55 food joints on Lincoln Rd in west Auckland. Episode 10: Burger Fuel.The man who ate Lincoln Rdwishes Burger Fuel all the very best. It's a New Zealand entrepreunial success story, a little burger bar which opened in Ponsonby Rd in 1995 and now has 22 franchises nationwide, as well as stores in Australia, Egypt, Dubai and UAE, with big plans to invade the US. There are 81 stores worldwide. People everywhere dig it. I can't stand it.I went there last Friday night. Lincoln Rd a er dark! The street was pumping, sort of. Certainly there were a lot of people about and they were all hungry. Burger King was quite full. Nando's Chicken was more full. There were couples in Hell, families at the strikingly   on
 misspelled BBQ Hut Nood les were eating nood les, and Indian curries were flying out the door at Saaj.Burger Fuel was the fullest of them all. It was packed, it was a scene. There were a lot of teenagers, also families with young children, and two pregnant women were carrying the next generation of Burger Fuel fans. I was there on date night. The man on Lincoln Rd knows how to treat a lady.Actually, it was Emily's idea; she's a fan of the so-called Low Carborator, which ingeniously does away with the bun and replaces it with lettuce. So you get a burger with all the fillings but you're holding two lettuce leaves in your hands.I wasn't having any of that. I ordered a Coke, fries, motobites (crumbed pumpkin, carrot, chickpea and ginger snacks), and a burger called a Bastard. The bill: $41.80. God almighty! That much? For a couple of lousy burgers and stu ? What's that about?And what's the point of fast food when it's not fast? We ordered at 7.38pm. The food arrived at 8.01pm.

The fries were alright, nothing special. The tomato sauce was special, because they had the gall to charge for it - 70 cents for a pathetic little punnet. Yo, Burger Fuel! STICK YOUR PUNNET BRO.The motobites were dry. The motobites were boring. The motobites were pointless. What I'm getting at here is that I didn't like them.But I wasn't there for the sides and the punnets. I was there for the burger, and I went straight to the top. The Bastard is the most expensive burger on the menu ($13.90), the biggest, the meatiest. The ingredients: grass-fed beef, melted cheddar, bacon, beetroot, mango, and avocado. It sounded sensational and let me say at once that it tasted sensational, too.Related articles:   LIFESTYLE | Food & DrinkNEW ZEALANDWhat its like to be the centre of social media hate

That is to say the cow and the pig danced a merry tune inside the Bastard, and I applauded with each chomp. The cheddar played rhythm and I could hear faint notes of beetroot. Of mango and avocado, not a peep, which was the first of my disappointments. I was really looking forward to the mango in particular.The hero was the beef. It gave good char. It was juicy, and delicious. As for the size of the burger, it was a big Bastard, and I liked that.But I paused to take a break, and test the okay fries and the tedious motobites, and swig the Coke, and when I returned to the burger it had turned into an old soak. It had wet its pants. It was soggy and sloppy, and the bun was like a full sponge. Bits of lettuce slid out, and the cow and the pig had drowned. I needed a full cannister of serviettes to wipe my hands.What's the point of Burger Fuel? It has so many pretensions, and chief among them is that it's somehow better than McDonalds or Burger King, that it's about natural ingredients and healthy options and BLAH BLAH BLAH. But neither McD or BK serve burgers which spring a leak.Burger Fuel is a poseur. It talks a good talk and it's fun being there, almost cool, but the food sucks.The hero of the meal was the Coke. That bottle of Coke was good. It added a point to the final score.

BurgerFuel Worldwide Annual Meeting Scripted addresses
8:30am, 5 Sep 2014 | MEETING
Chairman's Address, 7th Annual Meeting of Burger Fuel Worldwide Ltd, 
2.00pm Thursday 04 September 2014.

I would now like to overview the main events of the past financial year for the BurgerFuel Group of companies.

I am pleased to advise that the Group results for the year ended 31 March 2014 resulted in an after tax profit of $400,656. Whilst this was down on the previous year’s result, it was ahead of budget and in line with market guidance, which provided for continuing investment and expenditure on growth focussed initiatives.

Notability the Group has remained in profit whilst investing for future growth and more revenue. As at 31 March 2014 the Group had cash reserves of $8.6M and no debt.

This result was achieved on total system sales of $66.2M - an increase of 34.3% on the previous year ($49.3M) and group operating revenue of $14.4M, an increase of 20% on the previous year from $12M.

The 20.0% increase in Group Operating Revenue over the same period last year largely comprised long term, recurring royalties from existing and newly opened BurgerFuel restaurants. The 34.3% increase in BurgerFuel (unaudited) System Sales for the 12 month period represented a solid performance based on additional stores & a very satisfactory increase in same store sales. This again demonstrates BurgerFuel’s continuing popularity at a consumer level.

FY14 was a year of investment in people & projects which was necessary to prepare the company for future growth.

The results were in line with Directors’ expectations for the period, given the investment that has occurred and also the senior management focus required to achieve the Franchise Brands LLC deal during the year. It is important for shareholders to note that there were no “one-off” new country master licence fees taken in this period (as opposed to the previous year). Whilst this has affected short term profit, this was a strategic decision made by the Group for longer term interests, associated with the potential of the Franchise Brands LLC partnership.

In total 12 new restaurants were opened between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014, against 8 in the previous year and the total number of BurgerFuel restaurants operating as at 31 March 2014 was 56.

The Middle East remains a focus for further expansion. As at March 31, 2014 we operated 7 stores under Master Licence Agreements in Saudi Arabia, 11 in the UAE and 1 in Iraq, with more stores currently under construction in both the UAE and Saudi Arabia. In May 2014 we opened our first store in Egypt and are due to open in Kuwait shortly. In general we expect growth to continue in the Middle East where our brand is popular and well supported.

In the year to 31 March 2014 overseas markets contributed 40.2% to the Group’s total system sales and this figure is expected to increase over this year.

After a very big year topped off by the ground breaking deal with Franchise Brands LLC providing access to the SUBWAY system, BurgerFuel is again well set up for continued growth in both our existing and new markets.

The Company’s strategic plan calls for continued investment into the business to facilitate global expansion. That means all available resource will go into the business, as opposed to paying dividends.

Shareholders have however, once again enjoyed a significant rise in the BFW share price. The share price as at 31 March 2014 was $2.30, an increase of 52.3% on the 31 March 2013 share price.

On behalf of the Board I wish to record our thanks to all employees, franchisees, and other business partners for their efforts. I would also like to thank my Board colleagues for their support and the work that they have performed during the year.

Finally the Directors would like to thank all shareholders for their ongoing support. We look forward to continuing our work to support management and direct the business for the year ahead so the Company can continue to grow.

Thank You

I will now ask Josef Roberts our CEO to address you.

Chief Executive’s Address, 7th Annual Meeting of Burger Fuel Worldwide Ltd, 
2.00pm Thursday 04 September 2014.

Good Afternoon everyone and welcome to our 7th AGM. 
It wasn’t that long ago that I was standing in front of many of you at our EGM late in February. Obviously the big news then was the welcoming of Franchise Brands LLC as a major shareholder, giving us access to Subway’s expertise and capabilities. This is still extremely exciting news and will provide a huge stride forward in our future as a truly global company. I will elaborate more on this later in my presentation. In the meantime I will take you through some of the milestones we have achieved in the last financial year.

Before I start I would like to say that we did want to hold the AGM in our own office at 66 Surrey Crescent, Grey Lynn, but unfortunately the opening of our new ground floor offices and test kitchen facilities are not quite ready. I can however assure you that from next year on – our AGMs will be held at BurgerFuel HQ, giving you some insight into our culture and operating style, which we think is quite unique.

As Peter mentioned, and as detailed in our Annual Report, you will have seen we had some very good system wide sales results:

- System wide sales (unaudited) were up 34.3% to $66M 
- The Australasian region’s sales were up 25% 
- The Middle East region’s sales were up 53%

This saw our Group Operating Revenue rise by 20% to $14.4M and this result is mostly made up of sustainable and recurring royalty & sales income. This is a key point because in the past we have relied on the sale of one-off master territory licences to bolster our revenue and profit. Strategically the Franchise Brands LLC deal is a departure from these one off opportunities but I’m sure that the loss of this short term income will be more than out-weighed by the rapid growth of reliable and consistent future royalty income.

We always talk about system sales because these are the sales we generate in all BurgerFuel restaurants. However, due to our franchise business model, we don’t bank these sales as revenue, as they are banked by our franchisees, so our revenue always appears relatively low. It’s important for all shareholders to recognise that in fact our system sales now exceed $1.5M per week ($75M p/a) and we are focussed on hitting our next big milestone of $2M per week, generating BurgerFuel system sales in excess of $100M per year.

Net Profit after Tax was $400K. By comparison last year was $1.1M. As Peter mentioned, this was actually better than we expected and certainly in line with expectations and market guidance. We indicated that we would enter a period of consolidation, investment and preparation for growth. That preparation is going very well. The deal with Franchise Brands LLC is obviously a big component of that and this continues to be a large work stream for the Company. The talent in Head Office has increased and investment in IT systems, brand improvements, special projects and additional facilities have all occurred on a prudent and well considered basis. It’s worth noting that this will continue and also that we will be incurring considerable legal, travel and establishment costs as we enter the US. So our expectations on profitability in this current year do need to be moderate until the momentum from future openings is in full swing.

Before I move into regional results I would like to share with you some of those preparations that I referred to. These are important because once we are hardwired into the Subway development machine, we as a Company will face a whole new set of challenges.

Whilst our new partners will handle much of the day to day activity around store location and opening and running new stores, our challenges will increasingly be around support of openings, maintaining our brand integrity, enhancing our menu, transporting our special culture all around the world, and ensuring our Head Office is as streamlined and efficient as possible.

- Refreshing our brand identity and stores - Many aspects of our brand hadn’t been refreshed for some time. It was important that we completed this work as well as a full and in-depth analysis of who we are, what we stand for, and our strengths and weaknesses, before our growth accelerates and before we enter new marketplaces. A component of this that you all may have seen is the exterior signs, branding and overall look and feel of our new stores. A great looking exterior will attract more customers, better staff and even more interest from prospective franchisees. On the inside of our stores you may have noticed our new marketing materials are bringing forward the food, but in a way that is unique to BurgerFuel. 
The BUN – this stands for BurgerFuel Underground Network and it is a fantastic communication platform that brings together all our staff worldwide. It is also our HR, training, and auditing platform. It is now up and running in 4 of the 7 countries we operate in. The power of the BUN will be fully realised in the future through consistent training and communications from Auckland that cross international borders and also business ownership structures as most BurgerFuel staff worldwide are actually employed by our franchisees or master licensees. This will help keep the BurgerFuel culture alive in Abu Dhabi, LA or indeed right here in Auckland.

- Pixelpoint – we have completed a worldwide rollout of new in-store Point of Sale software. This simplifies our business a lot with regards to ongoing support, reporting and development of new customer facing applications and real time monitoring of sales and daily trends.

- Online Ordering – we launched this in NZ one month ago. We haven’t actively promoted this new channel however our tech savvy customers have already propelled it to a reasonable percentage of our NZ sales. Not only do customers love the convenience of this new channel – but it also reduces in-store till ordering, so should assist us in achieving a higher focus on those customers who are ordering in-store. 

- The big project of this year has been preparation for USA Market Entry – there are considerable regulatory requirements that we have been working on. As we focus our resource on the USA entry, we can see that this is a market that really has to be handled very carefully, both from a regulatory and market acceptance perspective. We continue to work on this and we are receiving excellent guidance and assistance from Franchise Brands LLC and Subway in the USA.

So as you can imagine HQ has been quite a frenetic place to be again this year, as we prepare for ongoing operational excellence during an impending period of rapid growth. If we could wave a magic wand and be ready to open in the USA that would be great – but the reality is – we are preparing for a major victory in that country and accordingly we are taking the time to prepare the business as thoroughly as possible – to ensure that we succeed.

Regional Results 
Australasia

Restaurant sales were up 25% in the region – and that’s largely NZ as we only have the one store in Australia. Although as I speak here today our second Australian store is very close to opening. Store development will continue on in NZ and we will also, in conjunction with our Subway development agents, begin to further develop the Australian market.

During the period, NZ restaurants that were open the previous year achieved a 12% increase in same store sales and we also opened an additional 6 restaurants in New Zealand.

One significant opening for us was our first South Island store in Christchurch. The Mainlanders had been continually tweeting, squawking, Facebooking and emailing us to open a store and we finally got it done. We crossed the Tasman Sea and Indian Ocean first, but rest assured, we will be bringing the Mainlanders more locations to choose from soon.

Throughout the year we refurbished the interior of most of our stores. Wherever we have done this the customer response has been very positive. We see strong sales performance in all of our refurbished stores and we will be commencing the second phase of our refurbishments later this year. This will involve better outdoor seating areas and sharper, crisper, bolder exterior dcor and signs. 
Late in the year we made some bold menu changes. The headline changes were:

- We now have a range of smaller gourmet burgers that are great for a lighter eating experience at lunchtime or snack periods or by customers that have traditionally found our burgers a little too big 
- More vegetarian offers (Tofu reintroduced) 
- A Low Carborator option where customers can substitute their bun for a lettuce, outer wrapping. 
- The Flame Thrower was added for our spice addicts. 
- We changed all our chicken to SPCA Blue Tick Approved Free Range Chicken.

We are very proud of our Free Range Chicken offer. There has been a little bit of controversy around Free Range over the last couple of months but rest assured, we only source from SPCA approved facilities and we have physically visited the farms to inspect them and size up a few of our future Chook Royales.

New Zealand has become an increasingly competitive market for fast food and especially burgers. Carl’s Jr. now have 16 locations in the North Island. And we’ve had niche burger bars opening around us as well as a proliferation of Mexican concepts hitting regions in their droves. Despite this – we have not noticed an effect on our sales and we take this as an endorsement from our customers that they appreciate our gourmet/premium/ethical and wholesome position in the market, as well as the value and vibe we deliver.

As I mentioned earlier we are putting the finishing touches on our second Australian store. That’s in Blacktown in North-West Sydney. Australia is now a marketplace that we are focussing on and we already have a few more locations lined up for our existing franchisee and our Subway contacts are lining up more opportunities. For commercial reasons I don’t want to elaborate further, but in the months to come you will see more activity commence in Australia.

Middle East

Our Middle Eastern restaurants were up 53% in sales. We opened 6 new restaurants throughout the year, 4 in the UAE and 2 in Saudi Arabia.

Dubai is now a city saturated in Western concepts such as Shake Shack, Elevation Burger, FatBurger, Johnny Rockets, GBK, Mooyah, Max Burger as well as the big multi-national chains you would be more familiar with. Despite this, we compete strongly against these brands and within our category we are now the largest brand with 9 sites throughout Dubai.

In the UAE we opened 2 stores in the second largest city of Abu Dhabi. and we hope to have another store open there soon.

Our first Egyptian store did not open within the last financial year but is now ticking along in the suburb of Maadi and we have a second store ready to open in The District. The District is an al fresco food precinct that is frequented by middle to upper class families looking for an entire day out.

Our first Maadi store is relatively low volume but we put this down to on-going power issues in Cairo which do not allow it to operate all day long and also in general the market there is still somewhat obscure among the turmoil that continues in Egypt. I think the good thing is – we are there and if and when this country evolves – we can evolve with it. Its also worth noting that we have strong local Egyptian partners there who are bullish about BurgerFuel’s future prospects in Egypt.

The Middle East in general has experienced major ongoing turmoil and brutal separatist activity in the past 12 months. Whilst we are in general away from the primary areas, we cannot escape what is happening in Iraq. Our partners did have our approval to re-locate their store in Kurdistan to Baghdad – pre the ISIS insurgency and that was set for re-opening later this year. However, given what is happening in Iraq – we have suspended all further activity in that country and will review at a later date. We only had one low volume store there, so this is not material to our position. It’s unfortunate that Iraq has slipped back into this situation as it was a country with enormous potential, but as we can longer enter that country for safety reasons, its best we cease activity there, which we have now done.

Libya is in more or less the same situation as Iraq. We haven’t proceeded to enter that country and with recent bombings there - again, it’s off the radar for future activity and like Iraq this will have little effect on our earnings.

A new country - Kuwait is due to open soon. We hope to announce the opening of that first store within the next month.

In summary, the MENA region proves to be a good performer for us, despite heavy competition and also surrounding regional unrest. Whilst Iraq and Libya can be excluded from further development for the foreseeable future, Dubai and UAE, Saudi Arabia and potentially Kuwait all represent solid growth markets for BurgerFuel and accordingly, we will continue to develop those as best as we can in the next 12 months and beyond.

BurgerFuel is increasingly becoming a global company. Our international restaurants now generate 40% of all BurgerFuel sales and that is a number we only see growing. In fact if our vision and plans come to fruition – which we have every confidence they will, eventually our current main market of NZ will make up only a fraction of our total sales.

Other objectives for the remainder of the year and beyond.

The USA and Australia are two politically stable and business friendly countries with a giant marketplace of consumers who love burgers! They are our focus for the foreseeable future. The USA is warming up economically and we see plenty of opportunity for us in that massive country.

Chris Mason and I have recently returned from the USA, where we spent considerable time and effort finessing the details of the contracts that we will use in the US, as well as working on the supply chain and all the hundreds of details required to ensure our business can operate successfully there. It’s very important for us that we get our new partners energised and excited about the opportunities BurgerFuel will generate for them. We want them to be motivated to open as many BurgerFuel stores as possible in the coming years.

I’m incredibly excited by this. For commercial reasons I cannot go into too many details just yet – but here is some information that might give you some idea of what this could offer us:

- Right across the USA there are many Subway Development Agents, which from here on I will refer to as DAs. These DAs find franchisees and sites for future expansion. They also employ an office of staff to help with openings and provide service and support to all stores on an ongoing basis.

- A number of these DAs are very interested in BurgerFuel as a second concept and we are currently progressing our first potential Joint Ventures there. Subway has been incredibly successful in the US. So successful that they are everywhere, with around 23,000 outlets in the US. Whilst Subway will continue its aggressive growth, there is definitely room for BurgerFuel to develop alongside the Subway brand and pursue a different category, which is also more based around dinner than lunch. 

- At the highest levels of Franchise Brands LLC & Subway we are being given great assistance and support to open up in the USA. I must say that it is fantastic that we have such experienced and professional people to work with and help us and I get the feeling that are also enjoying our unique brand and approach to market entry. The nomination of John Pfaneenbecker today once again signals their commitment to BurgerFuel. It will be great to have John assist us with a wealth of US specialist corporate and legal expertise.

Subway have been the fastest growing food franchise in world history and their assistance and structure really is a step change for us. These DAs are incredibly experienced food operators, site acquirers and franchisors. Our growth potential is now many times what it would have been if we had organically grown the business ourselves.

So I see enormous opportunities ahead of us. Once we get this ball rolling it will snowball in size and gather momentum. But it does take time, especially in the initial phase of establishment.

Think of it as building a Dubai skyscraper – the foundations for that tower will take some time to put in place and won’t be that visible to outsiders until the actual structure starts to rise out of the ground. That’s how I see the development of BurgerFuel globally.

In closing, the last financial year was very successful in that our same store sales growth was solid, our number of openings was the highest ever and we have completed a lot of work that will facilitate our future growth. The closing of the Franchise Brands LLC /Subway deal was mega for us and took considerable time and energy to achieve. I am very proud of that fact that we have achieved this partnership. As a tiny NZ company, we now have the biggest franchise partner in the world and it’s up to us to develop that potential and make this marriage work for all levels.

The fundamentals that support the health and wealth of this Company remain solid. We are debt free and recurring royalty income is stronger than ever before. Our existing franchisees and our new partners are motivated to grow and we look forward to growing alongside them. We need to keep investing, but we are focussed on building a big business and therefore investment ahead of the curve is essential to our future success.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you – our shareholders for your continued support. Also, our Board of Directors for their guidance and support.

I also wish to thank our Franchisees, our staff at HQ and all our store staff worldwide because their enthusiasm and passion is felt and appreciated by our customers throughout the world.

Ladies and gentlemen that concludes my address. Thanks again for your support and I look forward to sharing more good news with you in the coming months.

BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2014 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014The directors of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) are pleased to report an audited net profit after tax of $400,656 for the year ended 31 March 2014.Group Operating Revenue is up 20.0% to $14.4M with BurgerFuel Total (unaudited) System Sales up 34.3% to a record $66.2M for the 12 month period.It’s been an intensely busy and very exciting year at the BurgerFuel Headquarters in NZ and also within each of the 5 countries where BurgerFuel restaurants are operating. The Group’s organic growth continued throughout the period with the opening of a further12 restaurants, representing a new restaurant every 4 weeks. Whilst this result was a solid improvement on the prior year, BurgerFuel management recognised the need for faster growth and accordingly a significant portion of 2013/14 was dedicated to achieving amajor step change for the business. In Januarywe announced the signing of an agreement with Franchise Brands LLC (the owners of SUBWAY®) asa major investor in Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (BFW). The deal includes a collaboration agreement whereby BurgerFuel will access, under certain terms, the SUBWAY® system for franchise guidance and development opportunities. Since that deal was ratified in late February, BurgerFuel has been preparing the Company for rapid global growth, which is likely to commence in 2015, whilst in the meantime, continuing to steadily grow the markets in which we already operate.RESULTSGroup Operating Revenue is up 20.0% to $14.4M with BurgerFuel Total (unaudited) System Sales up 34.3% to a record $66.2M for the 12 month period.In line with our stated objectives and previousmarket guidance, net profit after tax in the periodwas $400,656 and whilst this was a reduction on the $1,098,294 net profit for the same period last year, itis in line with our earlier advice that FY14 would be a year of investment in people and projects, necessary to prepare the Company for future growth.The results met the Directors’ expectations for the period, given the investment that has occurred and also the senior management focus required to achieve the Franchise Brands LLC deal during the year. It is important for shareholders to note that there wereno “one-off” new country master licence fees takenin this period (as opposed to the year before). Whilst this has affected short term profit, this was a strategic decision made by the Group for longer term interests, associated with the potential of the Franchise Brands LLC deal.The 20.0% increase in Group Operating Revenue over the same period last year largely comprised long term, recurring royalties from existing and newly opened BurgerFuel restaurants. The 34.3% increase in BurgerFuel (unaudited) System Sales for the 12 month period represented a solid performance and again demonstrates BurgerFuel’s growing popularity at a consumer level.With the additional 12 new restaurants added between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014, against 8 in the same period last year, the total number of BurgerFuel restaurants operating as at 31 March 2014 was 56.BFW RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD 1 APRIL 2013 TO 31 MARCH 2014MIDDLE EAST REGIONSales (unaudited) across the Middle East have increased 52.8%. There are now 19 BurgerFuel restaurants operating in the region.Dubai opened 2 stores and the remaining 3 were in cities new to BurgerFuel; Al Hassa in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and 2 in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the UAE. Store Sales have been extremely strong, despite an influx of American Fast-Casual concepts. Compared to other branded concepts, BurgerFuel enjoys a high degree of patronage in the region and is well placedto continue growth. We now have a collection of prime sites in Dubai and are becoming a readily recognised and well-loved brand in the Middle East, like in New Zealand.In May 2014 we opened our first store in Egypt and we expect to open in Kuwait in July. We expect growth to continue in the Middle East where our brand is popular and well supported.GROUP OUTLOOKAfter a very big year topped off by the groundbreaking deal with Franchise Brands LLC and access to the SUBWAY® system, BurgerFuel is again well set upfor continued growth both in our existing and new markets. Project investment and process improvement have again been significant in FY14. The work in these areas is vital for building scale in the future, to support increased growth and efficiency.As previously announced BurgerFuel is actively preparing for entry into the USA. There are considerable regulatory requirements to overcome to enable us to offer a franchise concept in the US and we are actively working on these processes to ensure entry can occur as soon as possible. Franchise Brands LLC is assisting us in this area with invaluable guidance to enable an informed and educated US entry. We expect at least a further 6 months of regulatory and other forms of preparation will need to occur, prior to us being able to offer any franchises in the US.SUMMARYBurgerFuel continues to grow and the brand is becoming stronger both locally and internationally. The last financial year has seen considerable investment in the Company’s ability to increase its pace of growth. We intend to keep that investment up during this financial year and we are confident that our current sacrifice of short term profits will pay off in the coming years.The Directors are very positive about BurgerFuel’s future and we will continue to open new restaurants in new locations around the globe and in our home country, New Zealand.We have remained in profit whilst investing for future growth and more revenue. As at 31 March 2014 the Group has cash reserves of $8.6M and has no debt.Despite our strong cash reserves, it’s important to reiterate our policy of maintaining adequate cash levels for future investment and in this regard there will be no dividends paid. Shareholders have however, once again enjoyed a significant rise in the BFW share price. The share price as at 31 March 2014 was $2.30, an increase of 52.3% on the 31 March 2013 share price.The Franchise Brands LLC deal is a significant and strategic accomplishment for BurgerFuel and it positions the Company well for accelerated growth in the coming years.We would like to thank all our shareholders for their continued support and look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. We also wish to thank all our staff and franchisees and of course our valued customers31 March 2014 $000 14,416 (13,908)5084 0 1*** Expenses include; Operating expenses, depreciation, amortisation & interest expense.Total (unaudited) System Sales Up 34.3% to $66.2M.AUSTRALASIAN REGIONSales (unaudited) across New Zealand & Australia (where only one BurgerFuel restaurant is currently operated in Sydney) have increased by 24.8%.As well as opening new restaurants in the period, the Australasian business has also refurbished the interiors of 20 of its older restaurants adding more seatingand new livery. BurgerFuel continues to prove its resilience in the face of changes in the wider burger category with increased competition from Carl’s Jr. and aggressive pricing tactics between McDonald’s and Burger King. Our constant sales increases confirm that BurgerFuel customers have overwhelmingly endorsed our higher brand tier and high quality position in the marketplace. More recently BurgerFuel has enhanced this position further by adopting 100% free range chicken and free range eggs across all its New Zealand restaurants.We also received further consumer endorsement when we won our category’s Customer Satisfaction Award at the recent Roy Morgan Customer Satisfaction Awards in March 2014. This is the top award for service among the major NZ restaurant chains.The opening of our Christchurch store was hugely successful and from this South Island beachhead we will bring our “Mainlanders” more BurgerFuel locations in the near future.Revenue* Expenses**Net Profit Before Tax Net Profit After Tax31 March 2013 $000 12,032 (10,718)1,3141,098   Revenue includes; Operating revenue & interest income.  Peter Brook ChairmanJosef Roberts Group CEOFor further information please contact: Josef RobertsPhone: 021 444 786 PAGE 3PAGE 4

The company is an issuer in terms of the Financial Reporting Act 1993.The financial statements presented are those of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (the ‘Company’ or the ‘Parent Company’) and its wholly owned subsidiaries which are listed in note 12 of the financial statements.BurgerFuel operates as a franchisor of gourmet burger restaurants and is a for-profit oriented entity, incorporated and domiciled in New Zealand.2) BASIS OF PREPARATIONStatement of ComplianceThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“NZ GAAP”). They comply with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (“NZ IFRS”), and other applicable Financial Reporting Standards as appropriate for, for- profit oriented entities. The Company is a reporting entity for the purposes of the Financial ReportingAct 1993 and its financial statements comply with this Act. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars ($), which is the Company’s functional currency and they have been rounded to the nearest dollar.The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on the date set out on page 19 of the Annual Report.Basis of MeasurementThese financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities in specific accounting policies below.Use of Estimates and JudgementsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with NZ IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of judgments in preparing these financial statements are set out below:Impairment of ReceivablesThe Group maintains an allowance for estimated losses expected to arise from customers being unable to make required payments. This allowance takes into account known commercial factors impacting specific customer accounts, as well as the overall profile of the Company and Group’s debtors’ portfolio. In assessing the allowance, factors such as past collection history, the age of receivable balances, the level of activity in customer accounts, as well as general, macro-economic trends, are taken into account. The impairment of receivables is detailed in note 9 of the financial statements.Accounting for Income TaxPreparation of the annual financial statements requires management to make estimates as to, amongst other things, the amount of tax that will ultimately be payable, the availability of losses to be carried forward and the amount of foreign tax credits it will receive.Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses (where applicable) only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of reassessment by management or taxation authorities. GroupParentNet movement in cash and cash equivalents Exchange losses on cash and cash equivalents Opening cash and cash equivalentsClosing cash and cash equivalents 8,566,0584,197,9867,212,5773,094,245The attached notes form part of these financial statements PAGE 23PAGE 24
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2014 NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 20143) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe following is a summary of specific accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements that materially affect the measurement of financial performance, cash flows and the financial position.a) Basis of ConsolidationSubsidiariesSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is thefair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair valueof any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.If the business combination is achieved in stages,the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re- measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.The excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s shareof the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If there is a deficit (i.e. a bargain purchase), the deficit is recognised directly in profit or loss.Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companiesare eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policiesadopted by the Group.Transactions with non-controlling interestsThe Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevantshare acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposedof the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.b) Revenue RecognitionRevenue shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises those amounts received and receivable for goods and services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.Franchise FeesFranchise fees (incorporating master franchise fees) for the provision of continuing services, whether part of the initial fee or a separate fee, are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.RoyaltiesRoyalty income is recorded when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Training FeesTraining fee income is recognised when the twelve week training commences for the new operator and the outcome of the transaction involving the rendering of services can be reliably estimated.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)Advertising IncomeAdvertising income is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Construction Management FeesConstruction management fees are recognised on commencement of the store build and the outcome of the transaction involving the rendering of services can be reliably estimatedDividendsDividend income is recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the right to receive the dividend is established.Other IncomeAll other income is recognised when significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer, there is loss of effective control by the seller and the amount and costs can be reliably measured.c) Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment is established where there is objective evidence the parent and group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter into bankruptcy, or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payment (more than30 days overdue) are considered objective evidence of impairment. Bad debts are written off during the period in which they are identified. If these debts are subsequently collected then a gain is recognised in profit or loss.d) InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after due consideration for excess and obsolete items. Cost is based on the first in, first out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing condition and location. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.e) Financial InstrumentsThe Group has the option to classify its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets/ liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held to maturity investments, availablefor sale financial assets and other financial liabilities. Management determines the classification on initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. At balance date all of the Group’s financial assets were classified as loans and receivables.Loans and ReceivablesLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of selling the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after balance date, which are classified as non-current assets.Purchases and sales of loans and receivables are recognised on trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are thereafter carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.Other Financial LiabilitiesThese amounts represent unsecured liabilities forgoods and services provided to the Group prior tothe end of the financial year which are unpaid. Other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s other financial liabilities are trade and other payables, and these are usually paid within 30 days. They are carried at face value. PAGE 25PAGE 26
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2014 NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 20143) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) f) InvestmentsInvestments in SubsidiariesInvestments in subsidiaries are held in the Company’s financial statements at cost less impairment if any. The carrying amount of the investment is reviewed at each balance date to determine if there is any evidence of impairment.g) Share CapitalOrdinary SharesIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.h) Finance Income and ExpenseFor all financial instruments measured at amortisedcost, interest income and expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. The calculation takes in to account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense. Once the recorded value of a financial asset has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.i) Property, Plant and EquipmentRecognition and MeasurementItems of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self- constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributableto bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.Subsequent CostsThe cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amountof the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The following depreciation rates have been used:3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) j) Leased AssetsOperating and Financing LeasesLeases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired by way of finance lease are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the future minimum lease payments, and are depreciated as described above. Leases thatare not finance leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the periods the amounts are payable in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis.k) Intangible AssetsThe Group’s intangible assets have finite useful livesand are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. The intangible assets are amortised in the Statementof Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the period during which benefits are expected to be derived, which is up to 10 years. Where there has been a permanent diminution in the value the balance has been written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.l) Employee BenefitsShort-term BenefitsShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.The Group pays contributions to superannuation plans, such as KiwiSaver. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.Share Based PaymentsAll goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees are rewarded using share- based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions.Fair ValueThe fair value of employee share options is measured by using the Black-Scholes formula. Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exerciseprice of the instrument, expected volatility (basedon weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.m) TaxationIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss.Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.Deferred tax is provided using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amountsof assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.Motor VehiclesLeasehold ImprovementsInformation TechnologyFurniture & FittingsKitchen EquipmentOffice Equipment16% - 36% diminishing value 9% - 26.4% diminishing value 33% - 67% diminishing value 10% - 80.4% diminishing value 13% - 39.6% diminishing value 10% - 60% diminishing valueWhere an asset is disposed of, the gain or lossrecognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the carrying amount of the asset. PAGE 27PAGE 28

If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indicationsthat the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.o) Goods and Services Tax (GST)The Statement of Comprehensive Income has been prepared so that all components are stated exclusive of GST. All items in the Statement of Financial Position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables, which include GST invoiced. The operations of the Company and Group comprise both exempt and non-exempt supplies for GST purposes.p) Foreign CurrencyForeign Currency TransactionsTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of the entities within the Group at exchange rates at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, andthe amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss.Foreign OperationsThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to New Zealand dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated to New Zealand dollars at average exchange rates.Foreign currency differences are recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR). When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.q) Statement of Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and call deposits net of bank overdrafts. Investing activities comprise the purchase and sale of fixed assets and intangible assets along with any funding made available or repaid from franchisees. Financing activities comprise any changes in equity and debt and the paymentof dividends (if any). Operating activities include all transactions and other events that are not investing or financing activities.r) Earnings Per ShareThe Group presents basic and diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes share options granted to employees.s) Segment ReportingOperating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision maker; being the Board of Directors.The Group operates in three operating segments – these consist of the following geographical locations, New Zealand, Australia and the Middle East.There have been no changes from prior years in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss.4) NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTEDStandards and Interpretations Effective in the Current Period.The following new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2013. These changes are relevant and have been adopted.Amendments to NZ IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and revised NZ IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’The amendment to the standard introduces a single definition of control that applies to all entities. It focuses on the need to have both power and rights or exposure to variable returns before control is present. There is also new guidance on participating and protective rights and on agent/principal relationships. These changesdo not result in recognition of new subsidiaries or any previously recognised subsidiaries no longer being classified as subsidiaries.NZ IAS 27 is renamed Separate Financial Statements and is now a standard dealing solely with separate financial statements. It outlines when an entity must consolidate another entity, how to account for a change in ownership interest, how to prepare separate financial statements, and related disclosures. As with NZ IFRS10, this did not result in any material accounting or disclosure changes to the Group’s financial statements.NZ IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’NZ IFRS 12 sets out the required disclosures for entities reporting under the two new standards, NZ IFRS 10 and NZ IFRS 11, and replaces the disclosure requirements currently found in NZ IAS 28. Application of this standard by the Group has not affected any of the amounts recognised in the financial statements.NZ IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’The amendment clarifies the definition of fair valueand provides further guidance on how to determinefair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. However, IFRS 13 does not change the requirements regarding which items should be measured or disclosed at fair value. IFRS 13 applies when another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurements or disclosures about fair value measurements. The Group has determined that this new standard does not result in any material accounting or disclosure changes as it does not use fair value measurements extensively.NZ IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (amendment)This requires to group items presented in other comprehensive income into those that, in accordance with other IFRSs: (a) will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and (b) will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met. The Group has determined that this new standard does not result in any material disclosure changes.Amendments to NZ IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure ’Disclosure requirements about all recognised financial instruments that are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32. Disclosure of information about recognised financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements even if they are not set off under IAS 32. The Group has offset some financial assets with financial liabilitiesNZ IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’This standard outlines the accounting by entities that jointly control an arrangement. Joint control involves the contractually agreed sharing of control and arrangements subject to joint control are classified as either a joint venture or a joint operation. This replaces the disclosure requirements currently found in NZ IAS 28. Application of this standard by the Group has not affected any of the amounts recognised in the financial statements.At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:Amendments to StandardsNZ IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’Amends the definitions of ‘vesting condition’ and ‘market condition’ and adds definitions for ‘performance condition’ and ‘service condition’ (which were previously part of the definition of ‘vesting condition’) It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. The Group has assessed that the adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Group. PAGE 29PAGE 30
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2014 NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 20144) NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTED (CONTINUED)NZ IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’This requires an entity to disclose the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria to operating segments. It also clarifies that an entity shall only provide reconciliation of the total the reportable segment asses to the entity’s assets if the segment assets are reported regularly. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. The Group has assessed that the adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Group.NZ IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’This clarifies that an entity providing key management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity is a related party of the reporting entity. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. The Group has assessed that the adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Group.NZ IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’This amendment clarifies that when an intangible asset is revalued the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. The Group has assessed that the adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Group.NZ IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’When an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. The Group has assessed that the adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Group.NZ IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’This includes the new general hedge accountingmodel, and requirement to present fair value changes due to own credit on liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss to be presented in other comprehensive income. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The Group has assessed that the adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Group.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 20145) REVENUESale of GoodsFranchising FeesTraining FeesRoyalties 3,537,365 GroupParentAdvertising FeesConstruction Management Fees Sale of Fixed Assets (refer note 11) Foreign Exchange Gains/(Losses) Other Income6) EXPENSESOperating expenses include:Cost of SalesRental and Operating Lease CostsLoss on Disposal of Property, Plant and EquipmentDirectors’ FeesWages and Salaries1,726,863 90,000 - (110,893) 642,9678,032,505 308,061 105,0002014 2013 $$$$6,137,054 - - 1,142,372 - - 80,000 - - 2,613,123 - - 1,323,596 - - 90,000 - - 7,160 - - (16,129) - - 574,494 - -2014 $$$$2014 201314,331,86811,951,670-- GroupParentContributions to a defined contributionplan 73,259Key management personnel costs: (refer note 24)- Salary and other short-term benefitsAuditors’ remuneration – Audit Services – Staples Rodway:- Audit of Financial Statements- Advisory services – Audit procedures regarding Share RegisterOther Operating Expenses1,479,81246,4522,500 3,176,6795,409,602 459,93522,057 110,000 2,775,8404,202,719 - - 410,928 - -14,736 - - 103,333 - - 2,301,330 - -28,804 - -885,385 - -51,988 - -- - - 2,433,379 1,365 1,2072013 2014 201313,556,13610,432,6021,3651,207The above key management personnel costs include remuneration of the Group Markets, Directors and the members of the executive team.Chief Executive, CEO International PAGE 31PAGE 32

The cumulative amounts are released to profit or loss upon disposal of these subsidiaries.Share Option ReserveThis reserve takes into account the fair value of share options that have been issued to staff of the Group, but have since lapsed.Management provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Company and Group through internalrisk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.The Management reports quarterly to the Group’s audit committee, an independent body that monitors risk and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.Market RiskThe Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk exposures are analysed by sensitivity analysis. There has not been significant change to BurgerFuel’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.Foreign Currency Risk ManagementThe Group’s foreign exchange risk is limited to its US dollar bank account and the trading of its Australian subsidiary. It maintains amounts in the US bank account and transfers funds when foreign exchange rates are favourableForeign Currency Sensitivity AnalysisThe Group is mainly exposed to Australian dollars and Arab Emirates Dirhams. It also has nominal exposure to United States Dollars. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the NZ$ against the Australian currency. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally tokey management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit. PAGE 45PAGE 46

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance datewas outstanding for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.The Group was not exposed to floating interest rates on borrowings. The group has no borrowings and as such its interest rate risk is limited to the movements in the Official Cash Rate (OCR) and its effect on the interest earned on the Company and Group’s cash and cash equivalent accounts. If the interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s operating result for the year ended 31 March 2014 would have been $85,660 higher.Interest Rate RiskThe Group has no fair value interest rate risk because it does not have any financial instruments carried at fair value. The Group has cash flow interest rate risk from financial instruments that attract interest. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the Company and Group’s assets and liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Both the Company and the Group are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its cash balances and advances. There are no contractual rights in respect of interest rate re-pricing on its assets and liabilities that expose either the Company or the Group to any material risk.The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining minimal variable rate cash balances. Excess cash resources are placed into fixed rate term deposits where appropriate.7,212,577 - - 4,019,6677,212,577 4,019,6674,197,9862,747,6967,129,682-1,285,8081,285,808 Weighted Average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon-interest bearingTotal7,212,5774,019,66711,232,244 Weighted Average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon-interest bearingTotalInterest Rate Risk Profile GROUP2014Financial AssetsCash and cash equivalent Loans to franchiseesTrade and other receivablesFinancial LiabilitiesTrade payables$$$ Weighted Average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon-interest bearingTotal2.42% 8,566,058 - - - -- -- 138,000 3,411,0901,019,1248,566,058 138,000 3,411,0901,019,1243,094,245 - - 2,337,7663,094,245 2,337,766$$$3,094,2452,337,7665,432,0118,566,0583,549,09012,115,148-1,019,1241,019,124 PAGE 47PAGE 48
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2014 NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201421) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk that the counter party to a transaction with the Group will fail to discharge its obligations, causing the Group to incur a financial loss. The Company and Group have adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored by management and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, trade debtors, loans and advances.Except for cash and bank balances, concentration of credit risk did not exceed 15% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year ended 31 March 2014 or 31 March 2013. The credit risk on bank and bank balances is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. The maximum credit risk exposures are:NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201421) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) Capital ManagementThe Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Statements of Financial Position. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the required capital structure the Company and Group may issue new shares, sell assets to reduce debt and/or adjust amounts paid to investors.The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.Fair ValuesThe carrying amount of cash and advances reflect their fair values. There are no off Statement of Financial Position financial instruments, to which the Company or Group is a party, in place at balance date (2013: Nil).The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:(a) Cash, Bank Balances and Trade CreditorsThe carrying amounts of these balances approximate fair value.(b) ReceivablesThe fair value of receivables is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company and Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. The Company and Group maintains sufficient funds to meetthe commitments based on historical and forecasted cash flow requirements. The exposure is being reviewed on an ongoing basis from daily procedures to monthly reporting.Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. All payables are due within 6 months of balance date (2013; 6 months).BurgerFuel expects to meet its obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets. GroupParentCash and bank balancesLoans, advances and receivables8,566,058 3,549,0904,197,986 2,931,6967,212,577 4,019,6673,094,245 2,337,7662014 2013 $$$$Maximum exposures are net of any recognised provisions, and at balance date no loans or advances are past due or considered to be impaired (2013: $Nil). Receivables of $517,370 are past due but not impaired (2013: $Nil).CashThe Company and Group’s major concentration of credit risk relates to cash deposits with ASB Limited in New Zealand, and CBA Bank Limited in Australia.ReceivablesThe Company and Group have a credit policy, which is used to manage its exposure to credit risk. As part of this policy, limits on exposures have been set, lending is subject to defined criteria and loans are monitored on a regular basis. The trade receivable are payable on the 10th of the following month and loans are subject a loan agreement which stipulates monthly repayments.2014 2013 PAGE 49PAGE 50

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2014 THE TAKEOVERS PANELGRANTED EXEMPTIONS FOR FBLLC AND BFW FROM RULES 7(C) AND 15(B) OF THE TAKEOVERS CODETHE TAKEOVERS PANELGRANTED EXEMPTIONS FOR FBLLC AND BFW FROM RULES 7(C) AND 15(B) OF THE TAKEOVERS CODEA summary of the milestone dates for the call options is contained in the table below.CALL OPTION SHARE - MILESTONE DATESBACKGROUND TO THE EXEMPTIONBurger Fuel Worldwide Limited (BFW) is a Code company. Mason Roberts Holdings Limited (MRHL) is the majority shareholder in BFW.MRHL entered into a Sale and Option Agreement with Franchise Brands LLC (FBLLC) under which FBLLC agreed to purchase, and MRHL agreed to sell—• 1,606,057 voting securities in BFW, being fully paid ordinary shares in BFW; and• up to 23,853,420 voting securities in BFW, being an option to subscribe for up to 23,853,420 fully paid ordinary shares in BFW (the Call Options).BFW obtained shareholder approval on 26 February 2014, in accordance with the Code, to the allotment of voting securities to FBLLC under the Subscription Agreement and to the acquisition of voting securities by FBLLC under the Sale and Option Agreement. The disclosures under rule 15(b) of the Code in respectof the acquisition of voting securities under the Sale and Option Agreement could not be definitively determined in advance because the actual number of voting securities that will be acquired by FBLLC under the Sale and Option Agreement depends on whether FBLLC exercises the maximum number of Call Options. Accordingly, the Panel granted the Takeovers Code (Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited) Exemption Notice 2014 (Exemption Notice), which granted the following exemptions:(a) to FBLLC, from rule 7(c) of the Code in respect of any increase in FBLLC’s voting control that results from the acquisition of voting securities by FBLLC under the call option to the extent that the notice of meeting does not comply with rule 15(b) of the Code; and(b) to BFW, from rule 15(b) of the Code in respect of the notice of meeting, to the extent that rule 15(b) requires the notice of meeting to contain, or be accompanied by, particulars of voting securities to be acquired under the call option.DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THE EXEMPTION NOTICEClause 7 of the Exemption Notice requires that every annual report issued by BFW during the period commencing on the date of the meeting and ending on the final completion date, and in the first annual report after the final completion date, contains the following information:A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE CALL OPTION, AS APPROVED AT THE MEETING:The Call Options are exercisable in four tranches over eight years from the initial completion date. Each tranche can be exercised in full or in part. Call Options not exercised in one tranche will accumulate in the subsequent tranche.If Franchise Brands does not issue an Exercise Notice during any of the Tranche Periods, Mason Roberts Holdings Limited may sell up to 1,000,000 of the Tranche Option Shares (on each Tranche period end date) on the public market.If BFW reaches or exceeds its target of 1,000 openand operating Burger Fuel outlets by the eighth anniversary of the call option agreement, then the number of options will be limited to 35% of the total outstanding shares in the Company (if all options are exercised, which would take Franchise Brands to a45% ownership). If the Company has not achieved a minimum of 1,000 outlets by the eighth anniversary of the call option agreement, then Franchise Brands could increase its ownership stake to 50% of the total issued shares of the Company (if all options are exercised).As at balance date (31 March 2014) Franchise Brands LLC holds 10% of BFW’s issued capital (5,963,355 shares) & no call options have been exercised in this period. Each call option (tranche) is for a maximum of 5,963,355 shares or 10% of the issued capital. EGM26 February 2014Completion Date (2 Business Days post EGM)28 February 2014  Tranche One Option Shares Tranche Two Option Shares Tranche Three Option Shares  Tranche Four Option Shares Tranche Commencement Date 28 February 2014 28 February 2016 27 February 2018  27 February 2020 20 Day Exercise Period - Start Date  8 February 2016  7 February 2018  7 February 2020   6 February 2022  Tranche End Date 28 February 2016 (2nd Anniversary) 27 February 2018 (4th Anniversary)  27 February 2020 (6th Anniversary) 26 February 2022 (8th Anniversary) If the Average Market Priceof the BFW shares as at the commencement of the Tranche Period is Less than: NZD 1.49 NZD 1.64 NZD 1.80  NZD 1.98 The Tranche End Date will be either      Tranche End Date(+ 12 month extension) OR 27 February 2017 27 February 2019 26 February 2021  26 February 2023 Tranche End Date will be 20 Business Days after the Average Market Price becomes greater than:  > NZD 1.49  > NZD 1.64  > NZD 1.80   > NZD 1.98  Shares held by FBLLC at initial completion date – 5,963,355 Up to 5,963,355 Up to 5,963,355  Up to 5,963,355 Up to 5,963,355 FBLLC Percentage held of BFW issued capital at initial completion date – 10%  10%  10%  10%   10%(if less than 1,000 stores have been opened)   PAGE 65PAGE 66

The results have been audited by Staples Rodway.BFW net profit after tax was up 33% to $532,170 for the year ended 31 March 2015.Group Operating Revenue increased by 30% to $18.7M with total (unaudited) System Sales up 25% to a record $82.8M for the 12 month period.The Group has no debt and has cash reserves of $7.7M.The Company has remained profitable while continuing investment into its founding vision of one day becoming a well-recognised and admired global brand. Our determination has seen us once again overcome many difficult challenges as we move the Group forward to occupy an increasing market share in our home country of New Zealand, as well as other international markets.The past year has confirmed many aspects of BurgerFuel’s growth strategy as being on track. Our previous market guidance spoke of anticipated losses in 2015 due to the investment that we must continue to make as a relatively small NZ company, reaching out to build our brand on the global stage. Accordingly, we are pleased to have delivered a profit in the period.We can report many records in this year; Group revenue, BurgerFuel System Sales (now heading toward our first major milestone of $100M per annum) and a record number of new restaurants opened. These achievements come amidst a major focus on developing our relationship with Franchise Brands LLC and the opportunities within the Subway® network,as well as studying and coming to terms with the US market.The Company also purchased its second company owned store (BurgerFuel Henderson Limited) in October 2014. This will enable us to increase revenue and profits for BurgerFuel Worldwide Limited. It will also provide more training facilities for our forthcoming global expansion.During the past financial year we opened a further17 restaurants, representing a new restaurant every 3 weeks. It was a year in which we tested many of our own systems and abilities as we continue to prepare for the challenge of landing BurgerFuel successfully in the US.RESULTSGroup Operating Revenue is up 30.0% to $18.7M with BurgerFuel Total (unaudited) System Sales up 25% to a record $82.8M for the 12 month period.Net profit after tax in the period was $532,170 being a 33% increase on $400,656 profit for the same period last year. We had advised the market that losses were likely in this period as we did expect heavier investment into both the US and Australia. The deferment of this expenditure related primarily to management deciding that more time was needed to both explore and understand the US before major capital commitments were made there.The 30% increase in Group Operating Revenue over the same period last year largely comprised sales & long term, recurring royalties from existing and newly opened BurgerFuel restaurants. The 25% increasein BurgerFuel (unaudited) System Sales for the 12 month period was achieved as a result of solid trading performances and additional restaurants added during the year.With the additional 17 new restaurants added between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2015, against 12 in the same period last year, the total number of BurgerFuel restaurants operating as at 31 March 2015 was 72.BFW RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 1 APRIL 2014 TO 31 MARCH 2015Total (unaudited) System Sales Up 25% from $66.2M to $82.8M.AUSTRALASIAN REGIONSystem Sales (unaudited) across New Zealand & Australia have increased by 31.8%.The New Zealand business continues to perform well despite heavy competition in what is fast becoming an overcrowded market of food offerings – not just in burgers but in food generally. Despite this, Kiwis love BurgerFuel as evidenced in our store sales and our ability to keep growing in our homeland. During the period we added a further 4 restaurants to bring the NZ count to 40.Australia became a focus for us in this year as we opened an additional 5 franchised restaurants there to bring total Australian stores to 7. Australia has and always will be a difficult market for any Kiwi company to win over in the short term. We see the road ahead there as slow but steady. We liken it to starting the business in NZ almost 20 years ago – it will take time to build year on year sales and grow distribution. That said, we now have an increasing footprint and are working closely with our franchisees there to ensure that eventually we achieve prominence in this all important and potentially substantial market.Growth will continue throughout NZ and Australia in this financial year as we increase distribution by adding further restaurants in both the North and South Islands of NZ and in selected Australian locations.MIDDLE EASTERN REGIONSystem Sales (unaudited) across the Middle East have increased 14.4%. There are now 27 BurgerFuel restaurants operating in the region.The Middle East continues to experience major turmoil as a region but despite this we have managed to increase our footprint there adding 2 more restaurants in UAE, 2 in Saudi Arabia, 2 in Egypt and 2 in the new territory of Kuwait.We were forced to close our only store in Iraq due to the increasing security risks in that country. It was a very low volume store and its closure was non-material to our income. Equally we made decisions on Libya which will not be entered into and after 3 years of non- performance by our Master Licensee in Qatar, we also decided to terminate that agreement. We regard these events as non-material to our future prospects and revenue.In essence we see Middle Eastern development as primarily in the UAE and Saudi Arabia where we are well established. As reported last year both of these countries continue to deal with constant competitor arrivals in the fast food sector, but we are confident that we can keep building the brand as we have been doing since opening our first restaurant there 5 years ago.It is early days for both Egypt and Kuwait and to date store revenues in both countries are lower than our norm. That said our Egyptian partners are keen to continue development of more stores in Cairo as they take a long term view of establishing the brand. We will announce these and any other new openings in the region, during the course of the year.USAWe announced that we will be working with the Subway® network’s largest Development Agent – OhCal Foods LLC. Plans are well developed to enter the US and we expect to announce a first location soon. The US has required considerable time to both explore the market as well as ensure that regulatory requirements have been met prior to entry.GROUP OUTLOOKAs a Board we always prefer to remain cautious in our outlook, despite the fact that we are constantly working to both improve the existing operations and develop new markets. BurgerFuel is known for its determination and grit and in the end that’s what drives us to reach our global aspirations.The world is changing at a phenomenal rate as technology manifests itself in all sorts of areas that render the traditional ways of operating obsolete. Whole industries are struggling to re-invent their offer and remain relevant. We see this everywhere as we travel the world looking to establish in select markets that have potential. Competition is ever increasing and even the multinationals are now suffering atan alarming rate. McDonald’s has announced a considerable number of store closures as it struggles to identify itself and appeal to a new market of consumers. The millennials have overtaken the baby boomers as the “new and now” market that demands much higher standards than their previous baby boomer parents. BurgerFuel has always appealed to this emerging market.Revenue* Expenses**Net Profit Before Tax Net Profit After Tax31 March 2015 $000 18,678 (17,861)8 1 753231 March 2014 $000 14,416 (13,908)508401   * Revenue includes; Operating revenue & interest income.** Expenses include; Operating expenses, depreciation, amortisation & interest expense. PAGE 3PAGE 4
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2015  ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015               The Fast Casual sector that we operate in has developed very rapidly in the past 2 years so it’s incumbent on us to ensure that we can keep advancing and meeting customer needs. We feel that we take every opportunity to keep expanding; modifying strategies to suit changing markets as well as applying an enormous amount of skill and effort to get results. It’s not only our food offer that has to remain relevant but our brand, which we see as becoming more and more important to the emerging millennial market. BurgerFuel has always been about investment in its brand and this philosophy will continue as over time this will become our edge globally. The reality is that great brands take years to build, but we are well on the way.Following the recent deal with Franchise BrandsLLC which provides access to the Subway® system, BurgerFuel has a big opportunity to grow. It takes time to work out how such a relationship will actually operate and also to develop the right partners within the network. This is now well underway.As stated last year BurgerFuel is actively preparing for entry into the US. There is a lot of preparatory work required before we can confidently open in the US but we expect that this will occur this year. We want to be sure that we have got things right before we turn on the grills in the home of the hamburger and make our business a success there.The Board of Directors have set a FY16 budget which anticipates losses resulting primarily from the US expansion but which will be well within our financial capacity.SUMMARYThe Directors remain very positive about BurgerFuel’s future. We have a fabulous team of people that are working very hard every day to build the business. We have never been a company that talks of short term profits, none the less as we approach our first milestone of $100M in System Sales we can be relatively pleased with our progress. We have no debt, cash reserves of $7.7m, the partnership andthe courage and ability to make BurgerFuel a much respected global company.Despite our strong cash reserves, it’s important to reiterate our policy of maintaining adequate cash levels for future investment and in this regard there will be no dividends paid. Our share price remains buoyant with considerable swings at times but these are based on low volumes of trades as generally our shareholders, like us, are in for the long haul. We are a growth stock not a dividend stock and will remain that way for the foreseeable future.Once again we would like to thank all our shareholders for their continued support and look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. We also wish to thank all our staff and franchisees, suppliers and other stakeholders in the business. Everyone is working very hard and we appreciate that. Lastly thank you to our loyal and valued customers.Best regards`Peter Brook ChairmanJosef Roberts Group CEO   PAGE 5

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2015  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015                              1) REPORTING ENTITIES AND STATUTORY BASEBurger Fuel Worldwide Limited is a company registered under the Companies Act 1993 and is listed with the New Zealand Alternative Stock Exchange (NZAX).The company is a Financial Markets Conduct (FMC) reporting entity for the purposes of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and its financial statements comply with that Act.The financial statements presented are those of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited (the ‘Group). A list of its wholly owned subsidiaries is listed in note 12 of the financial statements.BurgerFuel operates as a franchisor of gourmet burger restaurants and is a for-profit oriented entity, incorporated and domiciled in New Zealand.2) BASIS OF PREPARATIONStatement of ComplianceThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“NZ GAAP”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 1993, the Financial ReportingAct 2013 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. They comply with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (“NZ IFRS”), and other applicable Financial Reporting Standardsas appropriate for, for-profit oriented entities. For the purposes of complying with NZ GAAP, the Group is a Tier 1 for-profit entity as defined in the XRB’s Accounting Standards Framework. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars ($), which is the Company’s functional currency and they have been rounded to the nearest dollar.The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on the date set out on page 19 of the Annual Report.Basis of MeasurementThese financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities in specific accounting policies below.Use of Estimates and JudgementsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with NZ IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differfrom those estimates. The principal areas of judgments in preparing these financial statements are set out below:Impairment of ReceivablesThe Group maintains an allowance for estimated losses expected to arise from customers being unable to make required payments. This allowance takes into account known commercial factors impacting specific customer accounts, as well as the overall profile of the Company and Group’s debtors’ portfolio. In assessing the allowance, factors such as past collection history, the age of receivable balances, the level of activity in customer accounts, as well as general, macro-economic trends, are taken into account. The impairment of receivables is detailed in note 9 of the financial statements.Accounting for Income TaxPreparation of the annual financial statements requires management to make estimates as to, amongst other things, the amount of tax that will ultimately be payable, the availability of losses to be carried forward and the amount of foreign tax credits it will receive.Preparation of the annual financial statements requires management to make estimates as to, amongst other things, the amount of tax that will ultimately be payable, the availability of losses to be carried forward and the amount of foreign tax credits it will receive.Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses (where applicable) only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of reassessment by management or taxation authorities.Refer to note 7 for additional information on accounting for income tax.Impairment of GoodwillThe Group reviews Goodwill for indicators of impairment at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the fair value of the cash-generating units to which the Goodwill are allocated. Estimating the fair value amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit in the forecasted period and also to determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The Group’s longer term forecasts are subject to a higher level of uncertaintyas it mostly depends on consumer spending, market conditions and level of competition. For additional information on the impairment test, reference is made to note 14.1 - Intangible Assets.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe following is a summary of specific accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements that materially affect the measurement of financial performance, cash flows and the financial position.a) Basis of ConsolidationSubsidiariesSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is thefair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair valueof any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companiesare eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.b) Revenue RecognitionRevenue shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises those amounts received and receivable for goods and services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.Sale of GoodsRevenue from the sale of goods is measured at thefair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, allowances and discounts. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs of possible return of goods can be estimated reliably and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods.Franchise FeesFranchise fees (incorporating master franchise fees) for the provision of continuing services, whether part of the initial fee or a separate fee, are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.RoyaltiesRoyalty income is recorded when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Training FeesTraining fee income is recognised when the twelve week training commences for the new operator and the outcome of the transaction involving the rendering of services can be reliably estimated.Advertising IncomeAdvertising income is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Construction Management FeesConstruction management fees are recognised on commencement of the store build and the outcome of the transaction involving the rendering of services can be reliably estimated.DividendsDividend income is recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the right to receive the dividend is established.Other IncomeAll other income is recognised when significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer, there is loss of effective control by the seller and the amount and costs can be reliably measured. PAGE 23PAGE 24
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2015  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015                              3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) c) Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment is established where there is objective evidence the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter into bankruptcy, or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payment (more than 30 days overdue) are considered objective evidence of impairment. Bad debts are written off during the period in which they are identified. If these debts are subsequently collected then a gain is recognised in profit or loss.d) InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after due consideration for excess and obsolete items. Cost is based on the first in, first out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing condition and location. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.e) Financial InstrumentsThe Group has the option to classify its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets / liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loansand receivables, held to maturity investments, available for sale financial assets and other financial liabilities. Management determines the classification on initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. At balance date all of the Group’s financial assets were classified as loans and receivables.Loans and ReceivablesLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of selling the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after balance date, which are classified as non-current assets.Purchases and sales of loans and receivables are recognised on trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fairvalue plus transaction costs and are thereafter carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.Other Financial LiabilitiesThese amounts represent unsecured liabilities forgoods and services provided to the Group prior tothe end of the financial year which are unpaid. Other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s other financial liabilities are trade and other payables, and these are usually paid within 30 days.f) Share CapitalOrdinary SharesIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.g) Finance Income and ExpenseFor all financial instruments measured at amortisedcost, interest income and expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. The calculation takes in to account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense. Once the recorded value of a financial asset has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)h) Property, Plant and EquipmentRecognition and MeasurementItems of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self- constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributableto bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.Subsequent CostsThe cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amountof the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The following depreciation rates have been used:i) Leased AssetsOperating and Financing LeasesLeases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired by way of finance lease are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the future minimum lease payments, and are depreciated as described above. Leases thatare not finance leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the periods the amounts are payable in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis.j) Intangible AssetsThe Group’s intangible assets have finite useful lives with the exception of Goodwill and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. The intangible assets are amortised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the period during which benefits are expected to be derived, which is up to 10 years. Where there has been a permanent diminutionin the value the balance has been written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.k) Employee BenefitsShort-term BenefitsShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.The Group pays contributions to superannuation plans, such as KiwiSaver. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.Motor Vehicles Leasehold Improvements Information Technology Furniture & Fittings Kitchen Equipment Office Equipment16% - 36% diminishing value 9% - 26.4% diminishing value 33% - 67% diminishing value 10% - 80.4% diminishing value 13% - 39.6% diminishing value 10% - 60% diminishing valueWhere an asset is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the carrying amount of the asset. PAGE 25PAGE 26
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2015  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015                              3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)Share-based PaymentsAll goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees are rewarded using share- based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions.Fair ValueThe fair value of employee share options is measured by using the Black-Scholes formula. Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exerciseprice of the instrument, expected volatility (basedon weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.l) TaxationIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss.Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.Deferred tax is provided using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amountsof assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.m) Goods and Services Tax (GST)The Statement of Comprehensive Income and Cash flows has been prepared so that all components are stated exclusive of GST. All items in the Statement of Financial Position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables, which include GST invoiced. The operations of the Group comprise both exempt and non-exempt supplies for GST purposes.n) Foreign CurrencyForeign Currency TransactionsTransactions in foreign currencies are translated intothe functional currencies of the entities within the Group at exchange rates at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss.Foreign OperationsThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to New Zealand dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated to New Zealand dollars at the average exchange rates for the period.Foreign currency differences are recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR). When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.o) Statement of Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and call deposits net of bank overdrafts. Investing activities comprise the purchase and sale of fixed assets and intangible assets along with any funding made available or repaid from franchisees. Financing activities comprise any changes in equity and debt and the paymentof dividends (if any). Operating activities include all transactions and other events that are not investing or financing activities.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) p) Earnings and Net Tangible Assets Per ShareThe Group presents basic and diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes share options granted to employees.The Group also presents Net Tangible Assets Per Share for its ordinary shares and it is calculated by dividing the net tangible assets of the Group by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.q) Segment ReportingOperating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision maker; being the Board of Directors.The Group operates in three operating segments – these consist of the following geographical locations, New Zealand, Australia and the Middle East.There have been no changes from prior years in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss.r) GoodwillGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. See Note 29 for information on how Goodwill was initially determined. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Refer to Note 14.1 for a description of impairment testing procedures.s) Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and non-financial assetsFor impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units).As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated (determined by the Group’s management as equivalent to its operating segments) are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.The data used for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group’s latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined individually for each cash- generating unit and reflect management’s assessment of respective risk profiles, such as market and asset- specific risks factors.The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Impairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the carrying amount of any Goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of Goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. An impairment charge is reversed if the cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount. PAGE 27PAGE 28

The main changes are:(a) Financial assets that are debt instrumentswill be classified based on (1) the objective of the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets; and (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.(b) Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on investments in equity instruments that arenot held for trading in other comprehensive income (instead of in profit or loss). Dividends in respect of these investments that are a return on investment can be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or recycling on disposal of the instrument.(c) Introduces a ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ measurement category for particular simple debt instruments.(d) Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.(e) Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities the change in fair value is to be accounted for as follows:• The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (OCI); and• The remaining change is presented in profit or loss.If this approach creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch in the profit or loss, the effect of the changes in credit risk are also presented in profit or loss.Otherwise, the following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from NZ IAS 39 into NZ IFRS 9:• Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and• Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities.NZ IFRS 9 requirements regarding hedge accounting represent a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting that will enable entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial statements.NZ IFRS 9 also contains a new impairment model based on expected credit losses. The model makes use of more forward-looking information. In applying this more forward-looking approach, a distinction is made between:• Financial instruments that have deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition and whose credit risk is not low.The Group has not yet assessed the full impact of NZ IFRS 9 as this standard does not apply mandatorily before 1 January 2018.NZ IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (effective date from 1 January 2017)The IASB and the XRB have now published NZ IFRS 15Revenue from Contracts with CustomersNZ IFRS 15:• replaces NZ IAS 18 Revenue, NZ IAS 11 Construction Contracts and some revenue- related Interpretations.• establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model.• changes the basis for deciding whether revenue is to be recognised over time or at a point in time.• provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics.• expands and improves disclosures about revenue.guidanceon:• contracts involving the delivery of two or more goods or services – when to account separately for the individual performance obligations in a multiple element arrangement, how to allocate the transaction price, and when to combine contracts timing – whether revenue is required to be recognised over time or at a single point in time.• variable pricing and credit risk – addressing how to treat arrangements with variable or contingent (e.g. performance-based) pricing, and introducing an overall constraint on revenue.• time value – when to adjust a contract price for a financing component, and• various specific issues, such as non-cash consideration and asset exchanges, contract costs, rights of return and other customer options, supplier repurchase options, warranties, principal versus agent, licencing, breakage, non-refundable upfront fees, and consignment and bill-and-hold arrangements.Transition to NZ IFRS 15 is retrospective, but it is subject to various practical expedients.The Group is yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the impact of NZ IFRS 15. PAGE 29PAGE 30

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2015  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 20157) INCOME TAX (CONTINUED)The Group has $1,799,967 of unrecognised losses to be carried forward (2014: $1,609,189). The potential benefit of these losses is $503,991 (2014: $450,573) which has not been recognised in the financial statements. The losses carried forward relate to the Australian operations.The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of $82,330 (2014: $50,954) with respect to other timing differences. This has been recognised as it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow the asset to be utilised.The weighted average tax rate of the Company and Group is effectively 34.90% (2014: 21.10%) based on operating in New Zealand and Australia. There are no other tax jurisdictions, other than New Zealand and Australia, in which the Group earns taxable income.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015                          452,718- 72,633 (14,691) 57,942(129,663) (129,663)325,6482,301 59,349 111,396 173,046(45,976) (45,976)Balance 1 April 2014Additions 309,639 Fully depreciated asset write off - Disposals (10,169) Cost at 31 March 201510) INVENTORIESFinished GoodsTotal Finished Goods11) PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT2015Cost$$ 20152014438,078216,130 109,141 - -Balance 1 April 2014Depreciation for the yearAdditions 309,639 Disposals (10,169)Foreign exchange impactNet Book Value at 31 March 201570,985 29,163 (646) -42,599 8,117 (646) -28,386 (8,117) 29,163746,317 297,035 (49,735) (2,208)349,370 99,952 (49,735) (52)396,947 (99,952) 297,035 (2,208) 52507,197322,183 (37,627) -375,038 117,026 (37,627) (2)132,159 (117,026) 322,183 - 21,256,125648,8761,256,125648,8768) IMPUTATION CREDITSOpening balanceAddProvisional tax paid Terminal tax paid Resident withholding taxDeductIncome tax refund received Closing balance9) TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLESTrade receivables PrepaymentsGST receivable Sundry receivables$$ 20152014 Motor vehiclesOffice equipmentFurniture and fittingsIT$$$$737,54899,502991,409791,753380,997452,718325,27150,070399,535454,435 201520142,608,072 61,512 1,207 72,9163,314,701 42,039 69 96,389221,948 (109,141)$$Depreciation and impairment lossesBalance 1 April 2014 Depreciation for the yearFully depreciated asset write off Foreign exchange impact Balance 31 March 2015Net Book Value- - -2,743,7073,453,198412,27749,432591,874337,318Receivables denominated in currencies other than the presentation currency are Australian Dollars and UAE Dirhams and they comprise 37.60% of the trade receivables (2014: 20.60%).

In assessing impairment, management estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or cash-generating unit based on expected future cash flows and uses an interest rate to discount to present values. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about future operating results and the determination of a suitable discount rate.For the purpose of annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the following cash-generating units, which are the units expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations in which the Goodwill arises.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015                          15) TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLESTrade payables Payroll liabilities GST payable Accrued expenses$$ 201520141,209,044 54,696 97,408 41,1991,035,908 - 41,440 36,3131,402,3471,113,661 20152014New Zealand RetailGoodwill allocation at 31 March16) PROVISIONSStore Closure ProvisionOpening balanceProvisions made during the year Provisions used during the yearHoliday Pay ProvisionOpening balanceProvisions made during the year Provisions used during the yearTotal Provisions$$ 701,427 - 701,427 -Payables denominated in currencies other than the presentation currency comprise 3.9% of the trade payables (2014: 13.0%). 20152014The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units were determined based on value-in-use calculations, covering a detailed five-year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows for the units’ remaining useful lives using the growth rates determined by management. The present value of the expected cash flows of each segment is determined by applying a suitable discount rate.$$ Growth RatesDiscount Rates201520142015201433,25032,050New Zealand Retail14.2) Growth rates2% -$$ 10.8% -32,050 1,200 -210,467 72,731 (9,955) 273,24335,850 3,700 (7,500)161,96168,597 (20,091) 210,467210,467 32,050306,493242,517The growth rates reflect the long-term average growth rates for the product lines and industries of the segments (all publicly available).14.3) Discount ratesThe discount rates reflect appropriate adjustments relating to market risk and specific risk factors of each unit.14.4) Cash flow assumptionsManagement’s key assumptions include stable profit margins, based on past experience in this market. The Group’s management believes that this is the best available input for forecasting this mature market. Cash flow projections reflect stable profit margins achieved immediately before the budget period. No expected efficiency improvements have been taken into account and prices and wages reflect publicly available forecasts of inflation for the industry.The Group have used different discount and growth rates to determine the value-in-use of the cash-generating units and have concluded that there has been no indication of impairment loss in Goodwill value. An increase of 3% in discount with no increase in growth rate from the 2016 year, would still not have generated impairment loss.Apart from the considerations described in determining the value-in-use of the cash-generating units described above, management is not currently aware of any other probable changes that would necessitate changes in its key estimates.Current 273,243 Non-current 33,250 Total ProvisionsStore Closure Provision 306,493242,517This is the make good provision that is set aside to cover the costs of returning premises that are occupied by BurgerFuel back to their original condition, after taking into account the natural wear and tear of these premises.Holiday Pay ProvisionThis is the allocation of the 8% annual leave entitlement that each full-time and part-time employee is entitled to as part of their employment, which is accrued throughout the year. PAGE 43PAGE 44

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance datewas outstanding for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.The Group was not exposed to floating interest rates on borrowings. The group has no borrowings and as such its interest rate risk is limited to the movements in the Official Cash Rate (OCR) and its effect on the interest earned on the Group’s cash and cash equivalent accounts. If the interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s operating result for the year ended 31 March 2015 would have been $77,210 higher.Interest Rate RiskThe Group has no fair value interest rate risk because it does not have any financial instruments carried at fair value. The Group has cash flow interest rate risk from financial instruments that attract interest. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the Group’s assets and liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.The Groupis exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its cash balances and advances. There are no contractual rights in respect of interest rate re-pricing on its assets and liabilities that expose the Group to any material risk.The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining minimal variable rate cash balances. Excess cash resources are placed into fixed rate term deposits where appropriate.$$GROUPProfit / (Loss) EquityInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis$000 $0006 51 4 37$000 $000(7) (56) (5) (56) 10,494,021 12,115,148 Management provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.The Management reports quarterly to the Group’s audit committee, an independent body that monitors risk and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.Market RiskThe Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk exposures are analysed by sensitivity analysis. There has not been significant change to BurgerFuel’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.Foreign currency risk managementThe Group’s foreign exchange risk is limited to its US dollar & UAE Dirham bank accounts and the trading of its Australian & United Arab Emirates subsidiary. It maintains amounts in the US bank account and transfers funds when foreign exchange rates are favourable.Foreign currency sensitivity analysisThe Group is mainly exposed to Australian dollars and UAE Dirhams. It also has nominal exposure to United States Dollars. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the NZ$ againstthe Australian currency. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit. PAGE 47PAGE 48

The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored by management and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, trade debtors, loans and advances.The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. The maximum credit risk exposures are:                            Interest Rate Risk Profile 2015Financial AssetsCash and cash equivalent Loans to FranchiseesTrade and other receivablesFinancial LiabilitiesTrade payables2014Financial AssetsCash and cash equivalent Loans to FranchiseesTrade and other receivablesFinancial LiabilitiesTrade payables$$$ 2.21% 7,721,033 - 7,721,033- - 92,000 92,000 - - 2,680,988 2,680,988- - 1,209,044 1,209,044$$$ 2.42% 8,566,058 - 8,566,058- - 138,000 138,000 - - 3,411,090 3,411,090- - 1,019,124 1,019,124GROUPCash and bank balancesLoans, advances and receivables$$7,721,033 8,566,058 2,772,988 3,549,090 Weighted Average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon-interest bearingTotal7,721,0332,772,98810,494,021 20152014-1,209,0441,209,044 Weighted Average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon-interest bearingTotalMaximum exposures are net of any recognised provisions, and at balance date no loans or advances are past due or considered to be impaired (2014: $Nil). Receivables of $453,712 are past due but not impaired (2014: $517,370).CashThe Group’s major concentration of credit risk relates to cash deposits with ASB Limited in New Zealand, and CBA Bank Limited in Australia.ReceivablesThe Group has a credit policy, which is used to manage its exposure to credit risk. As part of this policy, limits on exposures have been set, lending is subject to defined criteria and loans are monitored on a regular basis. The trade receivable are payable on the 10th of the following month and loans are subject a loan agreement which stipulates monthly repayments or payable on demand.Capital ManagementThe Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Statements of Financial Position. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the required capital structure the Group may issue new shares, sell assets to reduce debt and/or adjust amounts paid to investors.The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirementsLiquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. The Group maintains sufficient funds to meet the commitments based on historical and forecasted cash flow requirements. The exposure is being reviewed on an ongoing basis from daily procedures to monthly reporting.Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. All payables are due within 6 months of balance date (2014: 6 months).BurgerFuel expects to meet its obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets.8,566,0583,549,09012,115,148-1,019,1241,019,124 PAGE 49PAGE 50

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015Directors & Officers Board & Audit Committee Attendance RecordPeter Brook (Chair) Josef RobertsChris MasonAlan DunnJohn PfannenbeckerOfficersTyrone Foley (Chief Operating Officer)Mark Piet (Chief Financial Officer / Company Secretary)ConstitutionA full copy of the Company’s constitution is available on the Company’s website (www.burgerfuel.com).Board RemunerationDirectors are entitled to Directors’ fees, reasonable travelling, accommodation and other expenses incurred in the course of performing duties or exercising powers as Directors. Aggregate fees payable to the Board will not exceed $180,000 per annum, excluding the Group Chief Executive, CEO International Markets, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer/Company Secretary.Peter Brook, the Chairman, receives an annual fee of $60,000 and Alan Dunn the independent, non-executive Director receives an annual fee of $50,000. The Company Secretary attends to all company secretarial and corporate governance matters.Conflict of InterestThe Board has guidelines dealing with the disclosure of interests by Directors and the participation and voting at Board meetings where any such interests are discussed. The Group maintains an interests register in which particulars of certain transactions and matters involving Directors must be recorded.                            The Board of Directors is responsible for the corporate governance of the Group. “Corporate Governance” involves the direction and control of the businessby the Directors and the accountability of Directorsto shareholders and other stakeholders for the performance of the Group and compliance with applicable laws and standards.Role of the BoardThe Board is elected by the Shareholders of the Company. At each Annual Meeting one third of the directors will retire by rotation. The Directors to retire are those who wish to retire, or those who have been longest in office since last being elected.The Board of Directors is responsible for the overall direction of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited’s business and affairs on behalf of all shareholders. The Board’s key role is to ensure that corporate managementis continuously and effectively striving for above- average performance, taking account of risk.The Board:• Establishes the objectives of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited;• Approves major strategies for achieving these objectives;• Oversees risk management and compliance;• Sets in place the policy framework within which BurgerFuel operates; and• Monitors management performance against this background.The Board has delegated the day-to-day leadership and management of the Group to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.The Board monitors financial results and compares them to annual plans and forecasts / budgets on a regular basis, and on a quarterly basis reviews the Group’s performance against its strategic planning objectives.Board Size and CompositionUnlike the NZX Listing Rules for NZSX listed companies, the NZAX Listing Rules do not require that the Company have any independent directors. However, in the interests of good governance, and notwithstanding that there is no requirement under the NZAX Listing Rules, the Directors have decided to adopt a governance policy whereby at least two of the Directors of the Board will be “independent” as defined in the NZX Listing Rules. The size and composition of the Board is determinedby the Company’s constitution. As at 31 May 2015, there were five Directors, a Chief Operating Officer,and a Chief Financial Officer / Company Secretary. The Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee are non-executive and independent of the role of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.Audit CommitteeAlthough not required by the NZAX Listing Rules, to assist the Board in the execution of its responsibilities, an Audit Committee is in operation.(i) Risk ManagementThe Audit Committee is required to establish a framework of internal control mechanisms to ensure proper management of the Group’s affairs and that key business and financial risks are identified and controls and procedures are in place to effectively manage those risks. The Audit Committee is accountable to the Board for the recommendation of the external auditors, directing and monitoring the audit function and reviewing the adequacy and quality of the annual audit process.(ii) Additional AssuranceThe Committee provides the Board with additional assurance regarding the accuracy of financial information for inclusion in the Group’s annual report, including the financial statements. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring that Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited has an effective internal control framework. These controls include the safeguarding of assets, maintaining proper accounting records, complying with legislation, including resource management and health and safety issues, ensuring the reliability of financial information and assessing and overviewing business risk. The Committee also deals with governmental and New Zealand Stock Exchange requirements.(iii) Share Trading PolicyThe Company has adopted a formal Securities Trading Policy (“Policy”) to address insider trading requirements under the Securities Markets Act 1988 (as amendedby the Securities Markets Amendment Act 2006 and the Securities Markets Regulations 2007). The Policyis modelled on the Listed Companies Association Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines and is administered by the Audit Committee and restricts share trading in a number of ways.(iv) Insurance and IndemnificationBurger Fuel Worldwide Limited provides indemnity insurance cover to directors, officers and employees of the Group except where there is conduct involving a wilful breach of duty, improper use of inside information or criminality.6 3 6 3 3 2 5 3 3 -5 2 6 3 DirectorsBoard MeetingsAudit Committee Meetings  PAGE 61PAGE 62
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2015  THE TAKEOVERS PANELGRANTED EXEMPTIONS FOR FBLLC AND BFW FROM RULES 7(C) AND 15(B) OF THE TAKEOVERS CODETHE TAKEOVERS PANELGRANTED EXEMPTIONS FOR FBLLC AND BFW FROM RULES 7(C) AND 15(B) OF THE TAKEOVERS CODEA summary of the milestone dates for the call options is contained in the table below.CALL OPTION SHARE - MILESTONE DATES                                  BACKGROUND TO THE EXEMPTIONBurger Fuel Worldwide Limited (BFW) is a Code company. Mason Roberts Holdings Limited (MRHL) is the majority shareholder in BFW.MRHL entered into a Sale and Option Agreement with Franchise Brands LLC (FBLLC) under which FBLLC agreed to purchase, and MRHL agreed to sell—• 1,606,057 voting securities in BFW, being fully paid ordinary shares in BFW; and• up to 23,853,420 voting securities in BFW, being an option to subscribe for up to 23,853,420 fully paid ordinary shares in BFW (the Call Options).BFW obtained shareholder approval on 26 February 2014, in accordance with the Code, to the allotment of voting securities to FBLLC under the Subscription Agreement and to the acquisition of voting securities by FBLLC under the Sale and Option Agreement. The disclosures under rule 15(b) of the Code in respectof the acquisition of voting securities under the Sale and Option Agreement could not be definitively determined in advance because the actual number of voting securities that will be acquired by FBLLC under the Sale and Option Agreement depends on whether FBLLC exercises the maximum number of Call Options. Accordingly, the Panel granted the Takeovers Code (Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited) Exemption Notice 2014 (Exemption Notice), which granted the following exemptions:(a) to FBLLC, from rule 7(c) of the Code in respect of any increase in FBLLC’s voting control that results from the acquisition of voting securities by FBLLC under the call option to the extent that the notice of meeting does not comply with rule 15(b) of the Code; and(b to BFW, from rule 15(b) of the Code in respect of the notice of meeting, to the extent that rule 15(b) requires the notice of meeting to contain, or be accompanied by, particulars of voting securities to be acquired under the call option.DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THE EXEMPTION NOTICEClause 7 of the Exemption Notice requires that every annual report issued by BFW during the period commencing on the date of the meeting and ending on the final completion date, and in the first annual report after the final completion date, contains the following information:A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE CALL OPTION, AS APPROVED AT THE MEETING:The Call Options are exercisable in four tranches over eight years from the initial completion date. Each tranche can be exercised in full or in part. Call Options not exercised in one tranche will accumulate in the subsequent tranche.If Franchise Brands does not issue an Exercise Notice during any of the Tranche Periods, Mason Roberts Holdings Limited may sell up to 1,000,000 of the Tranche Option Shares (on each Tranche period end date) on the public market.If BFW reaches or exceeds its target of 1,000 open and operating Burgerfuel outlets by the eighth anniversary of the Call Option agreement, then the number of options will be limited to 35% of the total outstanding shares in the Company (if all options are exercised, which would take Franchise Brands to a 45% ownership). If the Company has not achieved a minimum of 1,000 outlets by the eighth anniversary of the Call Option agreement, then Franchise Brands could increase its ownership stake to 50% of the total issued shares of the Company (if all options are exercised).As at balance date (31 March 2015) Franchise Brands LLC holds 10% of BFW’s issued capital (5,963,355 shares) & no Call Options have been exercised in this period. Each Call Option (tranche) is for a maximum of 5,963,355 shares or 10% of the issued capital. EGM26 February 2014Completion Date (2 Business Days post EGM)28 February 2014  Tranche One Option Shares Tranche Two Option Shares Tranche Three Option Shares  Tranche Four Option Shares Tranche Commencement Date 28 February 2014 28 February 2016 27 February 2018  27 February 2020 20 Day Exercise Period - Start Date  8 February 2016  7 February 2018  7 February 2020   6 February 2022  Tranche End Date  28 February 2016 (2nd Anniversary)  27 February 2018 (4th Anniversary)   27 February 2020 (6th Anniversary)  26 February 2022 (8th Anniversary)  If the Average Market Priceof the BFW shares as at the commencement of the Tranche Period is Less than:The Tranche End Date will be either NZD 1.49 NZD 1.64  NZD 1.80 NZD 1.98 Tranche End Date(+ 12 month extension) OR 27 February 2017 27 February 2019 26 February 2021  26 February 2023 Tranche End Date will be 20 Business Days after the Average Market Price becomes greater than:  > NZD 1.49  > NZD 1.64  > NZD 1.80   > NZD 1.98  Shares held by FBLLC at initial completion date – 5,963,355FBLLC Percentage held of BFW issued capital at initial completion date – 10%   Up to 5,963,35510%   Up to 5,963,35510%    Up to 5,963,35510%    Up to5,963,35510%(if less than 1,000 stores have been opened)    PAGE 65PAGE 66

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016  ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016                              OVERVIEWThe Directors of BurgerFuel Worldwide (BFW) present the audited results for the 12 months to 31 March 2016.Group Operating Revenue increased by 9% to $20.3M.BurgerFuel Total (unaudited) System Sales up 16.6% to $96.5M for the 12 month period. (Please note that foreign exchange rate movements account for 6% of this figure, meaning actual sales growth on a year-on- year basis is 10.6%).Net loss after tax in the period was ($1,143,655) which is in line with Directors’ expectations.The group has no debt, and cash reserves of $6.1M.Our Group Operating Revenue increased by 9% onthe same period last year. This revenue is largely comprised of long term recurring royalties & sales. The 16.6% increase in BurgerFuel Total System Sales for the period is made up of both new and existing stores’ sales growth.We have added 12 new restaurants between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016 within New Zealand aswell as in Australia & the Middle East. We have also implemented the strategic consolidation of storesin both the MENA region and Australia and with this we have closed or relocated 4 stores in the MENA region & 2 in Australia. The total number of BurgerFuel restaurants operating as at 31 March 2016 was 78.BFW RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 1 APRIL 2015 TO 31 MARCH 2016have proven too difficult to operate in. Finally, our big mission remains entering the United States under the Franchise Brands and Subway partnership.TOTAL (UNAUDITED) SYSTEM SALES UP 16.6% to $96.5MAUSTRALASIAN REGIONSystem sales across New Zealand (47 restaurants)& Australia (where 5 BurgerFuel restaurants now operate) have increased by 21%. For yet another year, we have experienced strong sales growth in New Zealand.More restaurants are planned for New Zealand in both the North and South Islands in the near future and we are positive about our expansion plans in this market.BurgerFuel New Zealand is the third largest burger concept in the market and continues to act as an incubator and testing ground for the global business. There has been a heavy focus in the New Zealand market on development, and this has included upgrading systems and training programmes, increasing operational capacity and efficiency, kitchen and cooking process improvements and store design developments.We have had mixed success in Australia and as indicated, we would consolidate low performing stores as early as possible in their life cycle by either closing them or relocating them.We can see very quickly if a store will perform wellin a particular location and thus, earlier this year, we moved to consolidate two franchised stores withinthe Australian market. This was a financial decision based on the franchisee’s ability to perform within these particular districts. BFW has no company-owned stores in the Australian market, and as these stores are franchised, these closures have no material impact on the Group’s results.Australia remains a challenging and competitive market, however, we do see opportunity there and have achieved some level of success in certain areas. The concerns in Australia are around high operating costs and the length of time required to establish the brand, to the point where we achieve profitable individual franchised units. The Board’s view on Australia is to persist with a responsible level of investment for the next 12 months and review the position at the end of the FY17 financial year.MIDDLE EASTERN REGIONIn the Middle East we are focused less on the number of outlets and more on opening larger restaurants with higher turnovers. The reason for this is that retail rents in locations like Dubai remain extremely highin comparison to other countries and we also face economic volatility in these markets due to fluctuations in the price of oil as well as in tourist numbers. This,of course, means a shift in focus and resource tohigh performing stores as well as looking at the strategic consolidation of low performing stores where necessary – something we have always done in this market.As earlier indicated we saw very little future in Kuwait so long as regional terrorism and instability continued to contribute to lower volumes than originally anticipated. Subsequently, in January 2016 we moved to close our two Kuwait-based stores. Once again this had no material impact on the Group’s results.In Iraq, our partners there saw enough stabilisation to relaunch BurgerFuel in this market. In mid-May 2016 they opened a large new store in Baghdad and it is performing well so far (please note that these numbers are not reflected in the financial year covered in this report). Once again we caution the market that our outlook in any of these regions can change quickly due to the ongoing potential of volatility and terrorism in the Middle East. We will monitor this market closely with our Iraqi partners.Business in Saudi Arabia has continued to be difficult due to the Saudiisation programme that continuesin that country. This is where the government’s key objective is to have local people working as opposed to imported labour and it has been problematic for our Saudi partners staffing wise. In addition, Saudi has seen a proliferation of competitor burger concepts.Both these factors have impacted our business in Saudi Arabia, however at this stage, our Master Franchisee remains optimistic about BurgerFuel’s future in this country and thus we will continue to support the brand in Saudi Arabia, with the view to further growth over time.Whilst Egypt is a captivating and interesting market for BurgerFuel, the reality is that due to ongoing political turmoil, store turnover is low and consequently, this market will be monitored closely over the coming months with regards to its ongoing viability.The UAE has also experienced the effects of the regional unrest, but not to the same extent as other Middle Eastern countries, and this market continues to perform well for us. In an ongoing effort to innovate globally, a menu update was launched earlier this year, to further meet the requirements of this unique market. Whilst we do not believe there is much opportunity for increased store numbers in the UAE, we do see a solid business that can continue to grow year on year and accordingly our focus will remain on this market as a longer-term development opportunity.UNITED STATES ENTRYAs previously advised, our entry to the US has beena lot more complex than we first envisaged for a number of reasons. Firstly, the timing has been, and still is, governed by the relationship with Subway and Franchise Brands LLC. Subway itself is currently going through significant challenges and changes – largely due to the passing last year of Subway founder, Fredde Luca. Accordingly, we advise the market to expect further delays to our proposed entry into the United States.Although it could be possible for BurgerFuel to move forward in this market independently of Franchise Brands, we feel the potential support available from a large United States-based organisation is essential to our success in this market.GROUP OUTLOOKWe are aware that shareholders will be disappointedby the stall of activity in entering the United States, however the Group continues to make very good progress in other areas of the business. We also wish to point out that all markets, in general, are experiencing a massive surge in food concepts both in the burger space and other categories.In NZ in particular, we hold a very strong growth position and see great opportunity for continued expansion. The Board will be considering all options for the expansion of the Group both in New Zealand and internationally and in this regard, will keep the market informed of progress in due course.The Group is in a strong position, not only financially, but equally from a management and intellectual property perspective.The Group has no debt and as at 31st March 2016 had cash reserves of $6.1M.We would like to thank all our shareholders for their continued support and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.31 March 2016 $000 20,328 (21,374)(1,046)(1,144)*** Expenses include; Operating expenses, depreciation, amortisation & interest expenseTHE YEAR SO FARThe past year has been challenging in terms of attaining our international growth aspirations in the United States.

BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016 PAGE 7  AUSTRALASIASYSTEM SALES UP 21.1% ACROSS NZ + AUFor yet another year, we have experienced strong sales growth in New Zealand. BurgerFuel New Zealand is the thirdlargest burger concept in the market (by store number) and continues to act as an incubator and testing ground for the global business. More restaurants are planned for New Zealand in both the North and South Islands in the near future and we are positive about our expansion plans in this market.We have had mixed success in Australia,and thus, earlier this year, we moved to consolidate two franchised stores withinthe Australian market. As these stores are franchised, this has no material impact on the Group’s results.Australia remains a challenging market, however, we do see opportunity there and have achieved some level of success. We will persist in this market with a responsible level of investment for the next 12 months and review the position at the end of the FY17 financial year.            PAGE 8

In mid-May 2016 they opened a large new store in Baghdad and it is performing well so far.Our strategy for the Middle East as a whole, is to concentrate less on the number of outlets we have in this region and moreon opening larger restaurants with higher turnovers, in key locations. This alsomeans a shift in focus and resource to high performing stores, as well as looking at the strategic consolidation of low performing stores where necessary – something we have always done in this market.(MENA)       PAGE 10

Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial StatementsThe Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated  nancial statements in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internalcontrol as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated  nancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.Auditor’s ResponsibilityOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated  nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated  nancial statements are free from material misstatement.An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated  nancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal controls relevant to the Group’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated  nancial statements that give a true and fair view of the matters to which they relate in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e ectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated  nancial statements.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Other than in our capacity as auditor we have no relationship with, or interests in, the Group.OpinionIn our opinion, the consolidated  nancial statements on pages 16 to 51 present fairly, in all material respects, the  nancial position of the Group as at 31 March 2016, and of its  nancial performance and its cash  ows for the year then ended in accordance New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.Matters Relating to the Electronic Presentation of the Audited Financial StatementsThis audit report relates to the  nancial statements of Burgerfuel Worldwide Limited and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 March 2016 included on Burgerfuel Worldwide Limited’s website.

A list of its wholly owned subsidiaries is listed in note 12 of the financial statements.The Group operates as a franchisor of gourmet burger restaurants and is a for-profit oriented entity, incorporated and domiciled in New Zealand.2) BASIS OF PREPARATIONStatement of ComplianceThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“NZ GAAP”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 1993, the Financial ReportingAct 2013 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. They comply with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (“NZ IFRS”), and other applicable Financial Reporting Standardsas appropriate for, for-profit oriented entities. For the purposes of complying with NZ GAAP, the Group is a Tier 1 for-profit entity as defined in the XRB’s Accounting Standards Framework. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars ($), which is the Company’s functional currency and they have been rounded to the nearest dollar.The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on the date set out on page 17 of the Annual Report.Basis of MeasurementThese financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities in specific accounting policies below.Use of Estimates and JudgementsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with NZ IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of judgments in preparing these financial statements are set out below:Impairment of ReceivablesThe Group maintains an allowance for estimated losses expected to arise from customers being unable to make required payments. This allowance takes into account known commercial factors impacting specific customer accounts, as well as the overall profile of the Group’s debtors’ portfolio. In assessing the allowance, factors such as past collection history, the age of receivable balances, the level of activity in customer accounts, as well as general, macro-economic trends, are taken into account. The impairment of receivables is detailed in note 9 of the financial statements.Accounting for Income TaxPreparation of the annual financial statements requires management to make estimates as to, amongst other things, the amount of tax that will ultimately be payable, the availability of losses to be carried forward and the amount of foreign tax credits it will receive.Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses (where applicable) only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of reassessment by management or taxation authorities. Refer to note 7 for additional information on accounting for income tax.Impairment of GoodwillThe Group reviews Goodwill for indicators of impairment at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the fair value of the cash-generating units to which the Goodwill are allocated. Estimating the fair value amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit in the forecasted period and also to determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The Group’s longer term forecasts are subject to a higher level of uncertaintyas it mostly depends on consumer spending, market conditions and level of competition. For additional information on the impairment test, reference is made to note 14.1 - Intangible Assets.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe following is a summary of specific accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements that materially affect the measurement of financial performance, cash flows and the financial position.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES 19,294,72519,063,395198,204264,42995,10454,83119,588,03319,382,655 Net cash flows provided from / (applied to)operating activities 26Cash flows from investing activitiesCash was provided from:Repayments from franchiseesSale of property, plant and equipmentCash was applied to:Acquisition of intangible assets Acquisition of property, plant & equipment Acquisition of subsidiaryNet cash flows applied to investing activitiesNet movement in cash and cash equivalentsExchange gains on cash and cash equivalentsOpening cash and cash equivalentsClosing cash and cash equivalents 1746,000 46,000     (1,095,995) (2,617,520)6,078,2887,721,033The attached notes form part of these financial statements PAGE 19PAGE 20(725,018)1,687,098
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016                              (CONTINUED)a) Basis of ConsolidationSubsidiariesSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is thefair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair valueof any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companiesare eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.b) Revenue RecognitionRevenue shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises those amounts received and receivable for goods and services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.Sale of GoodsRevenue from the sale of goods is measured at thefair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, allowances and discounts. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs of possible return of goods can be estimated reliably and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods.Franchise FeesFranchise fees (incorporating master franchise fees) for the provision of continuing services, whether part of the initial fee or a separate fee, are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged for the use ofcontinuing rights granted by the agreement, or for otherservices provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.RoyaltiesRoyalty income is recorded when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Training FeesTraining fee income is recognised as the twelve week training course is provided to the new operator.Advertising IncomeAdvertising income is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Construction Management FeesConstruction management fees are recognised on a percentage of completion basis, as the store build progresses.DividendsDividend income is recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the right to receive the dividend is established.Other IncomeAll other income is recognised when significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer, there is loss of effective control by the seller and the amount and costs can be reliably measured.c) Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment is established where there is objective evidence the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter into bankruptcy, or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payment (more than 30 days overdue) are considered objective evidence of impairment. Bad debts are written off during the period in which they are identified. If these debts are subsequently collected then a gain is recognised in profit or loss.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)d) InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after due consideration for excess and obsolete items. Cost is based on the first in, first out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing condition and location. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.e) Financial InstrumentsThe Group has the option to classify its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets / liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loansand receivables, held to maturity investments, available for sale financial assets and other financial liabilities. Management determines the classification on initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. At balance date all of the Group’s financial assets were classified as loans and receivables.Loans and ReceivablesLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of selling the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after balance date, which are classified as non-current assets.Purchases and sales of loans and receivables are recognised on trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are thereafter carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.Other Financial LiabilitiesThese amounts represent unsecured liabilities forgoods and services provided to the Group prior tothe end of the financial year which are unpaid. Other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s other financial liabilities are trade and other payables, and these are usually paid within 30 days.f) Share CapitalOrdinary SharesIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.g) Finance Income and ExpenseFor all financial instruments measured at amortisedcost, interest income and expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. The calculation takes in to account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense. Once the recorded value of a financial asset has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.h) Property, Plant and EquipmentRecognition and MeasurementItems of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self- constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributableto bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.Subsequent CostsThe cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amountof the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred. PAGE 21PAGE 22
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016                             3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The following depreciation rates have been used:k) Employee BenefitsShort-term BenefitsShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.The Group pays contributions to superannuation plans, such as KiwiSaver. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.Fair ValueThe fair value of employee share options is measured by using the Black-Scholes formula. Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exerciseprice of the instrument, expected volatility (basedon weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.l) TaxationIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss.Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.Deferred tax is provided using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amountsof assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)balance date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.m) Goods and Services Tax (GST)The Statement of Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows has been prepared so that all components are stated exclusive of GST. All items in the Statementof Financial Position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables, which include GST invoiced. The operations of the Group comprise both exempt and non-exempt supplies for GST purposes.n) Foreign CurrencyForeign Currency TransactionsTransactions in foreign currencies are translated intothe functional currencies of the entities within the Group at exchange rates at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss.Foreign OperationsThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to New Zealand dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated to New Zealand dollars at the average exchange rates for the period.Foreign currency differences are recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR). When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.o) Statement of Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and call deposits net of bank overdrafts. Investing activities comprise the purchase and sale of fixed assets and intangible assets along with any funding made available or repaid from franchisees. Financing activities compriseany changes in equity and debt and the paymentof dividends (if any). Operating activities include all transactions and other events that are not investing or financing activities.p) Earnings and Net Tangible Assets Per ShareThe Group presents basic and diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes share options granted to employees.The Group also presents Net Tangible Assets Per Share for its ordinary shares and it is calculated by dividing the net tangible assets of the Group by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the year.q) Segment ReportingOperating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision maker; being the Board of Directors.The Group operates in four operating segments – these consist of the following geographical locations, New Zealand, Australia, United States of America and the Middle East.There have been no changes from prior years in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss.r) GoodwillGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Referto Note 14.1 for a description of impairment testing procedures.s) Impairment testing of Goodwill, Other intangible Assets and Non-financial AssetsFor impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units).As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.Motor VehiclesLeasehold Improvements Information Technology Furniture & Fittings Kitchen Equipment Office Equipment16% - 36% diminishing value & straight line (USA)9% - 26.4% diminishing value33% - 67% diminishing value10% - 80.4% diminishing value13% - 39.6% diminishing value10% - 60% diminishing value & straight line (USA)Where an asset is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the carrying amount of the asset.i) Leased AssetsOperating and Financing LeasesLeases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired by way of finance lease are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the future minimum lease payments, and are depreciated as described above. Leases thatare not finance leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the periods the amounts are payable in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis.j) Intangible AssetsThe Group’s intangible assets have finite useful lives with the exception of Goodwill and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. The intangible assets are amortised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the period during which benefits are expected to be derived, which is up to 10 years. Where there has been an impairment in the value, the balance has been written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred. PAGE 23PAGE 24
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016                             3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated (determined by the Group’s management as equivalent to its operating segments) are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.The data used for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group’s latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined individually for each cash- generating unit and reflect management’s assessment of respective risk profiles, such as market and asset- specific risks factors.The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Impairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the carrying amount of any Goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of Goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. An impairment charge is reversed if the cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.4) NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTEDAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:NZ IFRS 9 – Financial instruments (effective date from 1 January 2018)NZ IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for theclassification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.These requirements improve and simplify the approach for classification and measurement of financial assets compared with the requirements of NZ IAS 39. The main changes are:(a) Financial assets that are debt instrumentswill be classified based on (1) the objective of the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets; and (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.(b) Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on investments in equity instruments that arenot held for trading in other comprehensive income (instead of in profit or loss). Dividends in respect of these investments that are a return on investment can be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or recycling on disposal of the instrument.(c) Introduces a ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ measurement category for particular simple debt instruments.(d) Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.(e) Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities the change in fair value is to be accounted for as follows:• The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (OCI); and• The remaining change is presented in profit or loss.If this approach creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch in the profit or loss, the effect of the changes in credit risk are also presented in profit or loss.Otherwise, the following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from NZ IAS 39 into NZ IFRS 9• Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and• Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities.NZ IFRS 9 requirements regarding hedge accounting represent a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting that will enable entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial statements.4) NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTED (CONTINUED)NZ IFRS 9 also contains a new impairment model based on expected credit losses. The model makes use of more forward-looking information. In applying this more forward-looking approach, a distinction is made between:• Financial instruments that have deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition and whose credit risk is not low.The Group has not yet assessed the full impact of NZ IFRS 9.NZ IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (effective date from 1 January 2017)The IASB and the XRB have now published NZ IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with CustomersNZ IFRS 15:• replaces NZ IAS 18 Revenue, NZ IAS 11 Construction Contracts and some revenue- related Interpretations.• establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model.• changes the basis for deciding whether revenue is to be recognised over time or at a point in time.• provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics.• expands and improves disclosures about revenue.In particular, NZ IFRS 15 includes important new guidance on:• contracts involving the delivery of two or more goods or services – when to account separately for the individual performance obligations in a multiple element arrangement, how to allocate the transaction price, and when to combine contracts timing – whether revenue is required to be recognised over time or at a single point in time.• variable pricing and credit risk – addressing how to treat arrangements with variable or contingent (e.g. performance-based) pricing, and introducing an overall constraint on revenue.• time value – when to adjust a contract price for a financing component, and• various specific issues, such as non-cash consideration and asset exchanges, contract costs, rights of return and other customer options, supplier repurchase options, warranties, principal versus agent, licencing, breakage, non-refundable upfront fees, and consignment and bill-and-hold arrangements.Transition to NZ IFRS 15 is retrospective, but it is subject to various practical expedients.The Group is yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the impact of NZ IFRS 15.NZ IFRS 16 - LeasesNZ IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.The new lease accounting standard provides much- improved transparency and comparability of Groups’ lease assets and lease liabilities for investors and other users of general purpose financial statements.The Standard eliminates the classification of leasesas either operating leases or finance leases. Instead, there is a single lessee model which requires a lessee to recognise on the statement of financial position assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.NZ IFRS 16 will not have any effect on the total amount of cash flows reported but it is expected to havean effect on the presentation of cash flows. This is because, applying NZ IAS 17 Leases, cash flows relating to operating leases are presented as cash flows from operating activities while applying NZ IFRS 16 will result in the presentation within financial activities of cash flows relating to the repayment of principal on lease liabilities.The accounting requirements for lessors are substantially the same as those in NZ IAS 17. A lessor, therefore, continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and continues to account for those two types of leases differently.NZ IFRS 16 applies to Tier 1 and Tier 2 for-profit reporting entities, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.The Group has not yet assessed the full impact of NZ IFRS 16 as this standard does not apply mandatorily before 1 January 2019. PAGE 25PAGE 26

The potential benefit of these losses is $650,978 (2015: $503,991) which has not been recognised in the financial statements. The losses carried forward relate to the Australian & New Zealand operations.The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of $76,375 (2015: $82,330) with respect to other timing differences. This has been recognised as it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow the asset to be utilised.The weighted average tax rate of the Group is effectively 10.7% (2015: 34.90% based on operating in New Zealand and Australia).

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201614.1) Impairment testingBased on the impairment testing results, no impairment loss on Goodwill is recorded in the 2016 financial year.In assessing impairment, management estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or cash-generating unit based on expected future cash flows and uses an interest rate to discount to present values. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about future operating results and the determination of a suitable discount rate.For the purpose of annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the following cash-generating units, which are the units expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations in which the Goodwill arises.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016                          15) TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLESTrade payables Payroll liabilities GST payable Accrued expenses$$ 201620151,196,568 79,458 191,305 60,3581,209,044 54,696 97,408 41,199 201620151,527,6891,402,347New Zealand RetailGoodwill allocation at 31 March$$ 701,427 701,427701,427 701,427Payables denominated in currencies other than the presentation currency comprise 5.38% of the trade payables (2015: 3.9%).The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units were determined based on value-in-use calculations, covering a detailed five-year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows for the units’ remaining useful lives using the growth rates determined by management. The present value of the expected cash flows of each segment is determined by applying a suitable discount rate.16) PROVISIONSStore Closure ProvisionOpening balanceProvisions made during the year Provisions used during the yearHoliday Pay ProvisionOpening balanceProvisions made during the year Provisions used during the yearTotal Provisions$$ 20162015 Growth RatesDiscount Rates2016201520162015New Zealand Retail14.2) Growth rates3% 2%9.6% 10.8%33,250 1,200 -273,243 77,744 (43,768)32,050 1,200 -210,467 72,731 (9,955)273,243 33,25034,45033,250The growth rates reflect the long-term average growth rates for the product lines and industries of the segments (all publicly available).14.3) Discount ratesThe discount rates reflect appropriate adjustments relating to market risk and specific risk factors of each unit.14.4) Cash flow assumptionsManagement’s key assumptions include stable profit margins, based on past experience in this market. The Group’s management believes that this is the best available input for forecasting this mature market. Cash flow projections reflect stable profit margins achieved immediately before the budget period. No expected efficiency improvements have been taken into account and prices and wages reflect publicly available forecasts of inflation for the industry.The Group have used different discount and growth rates to determine the value-in-use of the cash-generating units and have concluded that there has been no indication of impairment loss in Goodwill value. An increase of 3% in Discount with no increase in Growth rate from the 2016 year would still not have generated impairment loss.Apart from the considerations described in determining the value-in-use of the cash-generating units described above, management is not currently aware of any other probable changes that would necessitate changes in its key estimates.Current 307,219 Non-current 34,450 Total ProvisionsStore Closure Provision307,219273,243341,669306,493341,669306,493This is the make good provision that is set aside to cover the costs of returning premises that are occupied by BurgerFuel back to their original condition, after taking into account the normal wear and tear of these premises.Holiday Pay ProvisionThis is the allocation of the 8% annual leave entitlement that each full-time and part-time employee is entitled to as part of their employment, which is accrued throughout the year. PAGE 39PAGE 40

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201621) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)Financial Risk Management ObjectivesManagement provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.The Management reports quarterly to the Group’s audit committee, an independent body that monitors risk and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.Market RiskThe Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk exposures are analysed by sensitivity analysis. There has not been significant change to BurgerFuel’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.Foreign currency risk managementThe Group’s foreign exchange risk is limited to its US dollar, Australian Dollar & UAE Dirham bank accounts and the trading of its Australian, US & United Arab Emirates subsidiary’s. It maintains amounts in these foreign bank accounts and transfers funds when foreign exchange rates are favourable.Foreign currency sensitivity analysisThe Group is mainly exposed to Australian dollars, US Dollars and UAE Dirhams. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the NZ$ against the Australian, UAE & USA currency. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201621) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)Interest Rate RiskThe Group has no fair value interest rate risk because it does not have any financial instruments carried at fair value. The Group has cash flow interest rate risk from financial instruments that attract interest. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the Group’s assets and liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its cash balances and advances.There are no contractual rights in respect of interest rate re-pricing on its assets and liabilities that expose the Group to any material risk.The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining minimal variable rate cash balances. Excess cash resources are placed into fixed rate term deposits where appropriate.                             Weighted average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon - interest bearingTotal6,078,2882,528,8428,607,130-1,196,5681,196,568GROUPProfit / (Loss) EquityInterest rate sensitivity analysis$000 $00028 6 20 4$000 $000(31) (7) (31) (5)Interest rate risk profile 2016Financial AssetsCash and cash equivalent Loans to FranchiseesTrade and other receivablesFinancial LiabilitiesTrade payables2015Financial AssetsCash and cash equivalent Loans to FranchiseesTrade and other receivablesFinancial LiabilitiesTrade payables$$$ 2.34% 6,078,288 - 6,078,288- - 46,000 46,000 - - 2,482,842 2,482,842- - 1,196,568 1,196,568$$$2.21% 7,721,033 - 7,721,033 - - 92,000 92,000 - - 2,680,988 2,680,988- - 1,209,044 1,209,044 10%Strengthening10%Weakening2016201520162015 Weighted average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon - interest bearingTotal7,721,0332,772,98810,494,021The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance datewas outstanding for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.The Group has a USD overdraft facility and has exposure to floating interest rates on this facility.This USD overdraft facility has an effect on the interest paid on the Group’s cash and cash equivalent accounts.If the interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s operating result for the year ended 31 March 2016 would have been $60,782 higher (2015: $77,210 higher).-1,209,0441,209,044 PAGE 43PAGE 44
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2016  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201621) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk that the counter party to a transaction with the Group will fail to discharge its obligations, causing the Group to incur a financial loss. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored by management and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, trade debtors, loans and advances.The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. The maximum credit risk exposures are:NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201622) COMMITMENTSLease CommitmentsOperating leases relate to the store leases.

Receivables of $634,362 are impaired with no further amounts past due (2015: $453,712 past due).CashThe Group’s major concentration of credit risk relates to cash deposits with ASB Limited in New Zealand, CBA Bank Limited in Australia & Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the USA.ReceivablesThe Group has a credit policy, which is used to manage its exposure to credit risk. As part of this policy, limits on exposures have been set, lending is subject to defined criteria and loans are monitored on a regular basis. The trade receivable are payable on the 10th of the following month and loans are subject a loan agreement which stipulates monthly repayments or payable on demand.Capital ManagementThe Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Statements of Financial Position. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the required capital structure the Group may issue new shares, sell assets to reduce debt and/or adjust amounts paid to investors.The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. The Group maintains sufficient funds to meet the commitments based on historical and forecasted cash flow requirements. The exposure is being reviewed on an ongoing basis from daily procedures to monthly reporting.Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. All payables are due within 6 months of balance date (2015: 6 months).BurgerFuel expects to meet its obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets.$$$$Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. BurgerFuel holds the head lease over all of its franchisee sites with the exceptionof Takapuna and the Australia stores and in turn licenses each of these sites to its franchisees under the same terms and conditions. At balance date, the total value of lease commitments under this arrangement was $3,043,526 (2015: $2,765,330).Capital CommitmentsAt 31 March 2016, no capital expenditure (2015: Nil) had been committed under contractual arrangements with substantially all payments due within one year.Indemnity / GuaranteesBurgerFuel has term deposits in place to cover certain commitments the banks have provided: 20162015Total future minimum paymentsTotal future minimum paymentsNZX BondBond for Newtown PremisesBond for Australian Kitchen Premises23) CONTINGENCIESThe Group has no contingencies at balance date (2015: Nil).20,000 32,483 11,12920,000 29,837 10,22363,61260,060 PAGE 45PAGE 46

The Board’s key role is to ensure that corporate managementis continuously and effectively striving for above- average performance, taking account of risk.The Board:• Establishes the objectives of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited;• Approves major strategies for achieving these objectives;• Oversees risk management and compliance;• Sets in place the policy framework within which BurgerFuel operates; and• Monitors management performance against this background.The Board has delegated the day-to-day leadership and management of the Group to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.The Board monitors financial results and compares them to annual plans and forecasts / budgets on a regular basis, and on a quarterly basis reviews the Group’s performance against its strategic planning objectives.Board size and CompositionUnlike the NZX Listing Rules for NZSX listed companies, the NZAX Listing Rules do not require that the Company have any independent directors. However, in the interests of good governance, and notwithstanding that there is no requirement under the NZAX Listing Rules, the Directors have decided to adopt a governance policy whereby at least two of the Directors of the Board will be “independent” as defined in the NZX Listing Rules. The size and composition of the Board is determinedby the Company’s constitution. As at 31 May 2016, there were five Directors, a Chief Operating Officer, and a Chief Financial Officer / Company Secretary.The Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee are non-executive and independent of the role of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.Audit CommitteeAlthough not required by the NZAX Listing Rules, to assist the Board in the execution of its responsibilities, an Audit Committee is in operation.(i) Risk ManagementThe Audit Committee is required to establish a framework of internal control mechanisms to ensure proper management of the Group’s affairs and that key business and financial risks are identified and controls and procedures are in place to effectively manage those risks. The Audit Committee is accountable to the Board for the recommendation of the external auditors, directing and monitoring the audit function and reviewing the adequacy and quality of the annual audit process.(ii) Additional AssuranceThe Committee provides the Board with additional assurance regarding the accuracy of financial information for inclusion in the Group’s annual report, including the financial statements. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring that Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited has an effective internal control framework. These controls include the safeguarding of assets, maintaining proper accounting records, complying with legislation, including resource management and health and safety issues, ensuring the reliability of financial information and assessing and overviewing business risk. The Committee also deals with governmental and New Zealand Stock Exchange requirements.(iii) Share Trading PolicyThe Company has adopted a formal Securities Trading Policy (“Policy”) to address insider trading requirements under the Securities Markets Act 1988 (as amendedby the Securities Markets Amendment Act 2006 and the Securities Markets Regulations 2007). The Policyis modelled on the Listed Companies Association Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines and is administered by the Audit Committee and restricts share trading in a number of ways.(iv) Insurance and IndemnificationBurger Fuel Worldwide Limited provides indemnity insurance cover to directors, officers and employees of the Group except where there is conduct involving a wilful breach of duty, improper use of inside information or criminality.6 4 6 4 4 1 6 4 4 -6 4 6 4 DirectorsBoard MeetingsAudit Committee Meetings  PAGE 55PAGE 56

Mason Roberts Holdings Limited (MRHL) is the majority shareholder in BFW.MRHL entered into a Sale and Option Agreement with Franchise Brands LLC (FBLLC) under which FBLLC agreed to purchase, and MRHL agreed to sell—• 1,606,057 voting securities in BFW, being fully paid ordinary shares in BFW; and• up to 23,853,420 voting securities in BFW, being an option to subscribe for up to 23,853,420 fully paid ordinary shares in BFW (the Call Options).BFW obtained shareholder approval on 26 February 2014, in accordance with the Code, to the allotment of voting securities to FBLLC under the Subscription Agreement and to the acquisition of voting securities by FBLLC under the Sale and Option Agreement. The disclosures under rule 15(b) of the Code in respectof the acquisition of voting securities under the Sale and Option Agreement could not be definitively determined in advance because the actual number of voting securities that will be acquired by FBLLC under the Sale and Option Agreement depends on whether FBLLC exercises the maximum number of Call Options. Accordingly, the Panel granted the Takeovers Code (Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited) Exemption Notice 2014 (Exemption Notice), which granted the following exemptions:DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THE EXEMPTION NOTICEClause 7 of the Exemption Notice requires that every annual report issued by BFW during the period commencing on the date of the meeting and ending on the final completion date, and in the first annual report after the final completion date, contains the following information:A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE CALLOPTION, AS APPROVED AT THE MEETING:The Call Options are exercisable in four tranches over eight years from the initial completion date. Each tranche can be exercised in full or in part. Call Options not exercised in one tranche will accumulate in the subsequent tranche.If Franchise Brands does not issue an Exercise Notice during any of the Tranche Periods, Mason Roberts Holdings Limited may sell up to 1,000,000 of the Tranche Option Shares (on each tranche period end date) on the public market.If BFW reaches or exceeds its target of 1,000 open and operating BurgerFuel outlets by the eighth anniversary of the Call Option agreement, then the number of options will be limited to 35% of the total outstanding shares in the Company (if all options are exercised, which would take Franchise Brands to a 45% ownership). If the Company has not achieved a minimum of 1,000 outlets by the eighth anniversary of the Call Option agreement, then Franchise Brands could increase its ownership stake to 50% of the total issued shares of the Company (if all options are exercised).As at balance date (31 March 2016) Franchise Brands LLC holds 10% of BFW’s issued capital (5,963,355 shares) & no Call Options have been exercised in this period. Each Call Option (tranche) is for a maximum of 5,963,355 shares or 10% of the issued capital.(a)(b)to FBLLC, from rule 7(c) of the Code in respect of any increase in FBLLC’s voting control that results from the acquisition of voting securities by FBLLC under the call option to the extent that the notice of meeting does not comply with rule 15(b) of the Code; andto BFW, from rule 15(b) of the Code in respect of the notice of meeting, to the extent that rule 15(b) requires the notice of meeting to contain, or be accompanied by, particulars of voting securities to be acquired under the call option.PAGE 58

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017  ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017                              OVERVIEWThe Directors of BurgerFuel Worldwide (BFW) are pleased to present audited results for the 12 months to 31 March 2017.Group Operating Revenue increased by 9.9% to $22.3M. BurgerFuel Total (unaudited) System Sales are up 5.78% to $102M* for the 12 month period, a key milestone for the Group.(*Please note; taking foreign exchange rate movements’ into account, the adjusted total system sales growth on a year-on-year basis is 4.0% equalling $100M).Net Profit after tax for the period was $888,948 representing an increase of 178% on last year.This result is particularly pleasing considering thecosts associated with the annulment of the Franchise Brands relationship and the resulting expenditure that occurred in order for BFW to enter the USA on its own. It should, however, be noted that further costs for the support and opening of the USA store have occurred in the early months of FY18.Our Group Operating Revenue increased by 9.9%on the same period last year. This revenue is largely comprised of long-term recurring royalties and sales. The 4.0% increase in BurgerFuel Total System Sales for the period is made up of both new and existing stores’ sales growth.We have added nine new restaurants between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 within New Zealand as wellas in Iraq and Egypt (relocation). As at 31 March 2017 there were 86 BurgerFuel stores operating worldwide.BFW RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD 1 APRIL 2016 TO 31 MARCH 2017TOTAL (UNAUDITED) SYSTEM SALES UP 4.0% to $100MAUSTRALASIAN REGIONSystem sales across New Zealand (54 restaurants) and Australia (5 restaurants) increased by 15%.In New Zealand, we continue to strengthen our growth position. BurgerFuel remains the largest gourmet burger chain in this market, and the third largest burger concept overall.As well as functioning as a highly successful business unit in its own right, the New Zealand business continues to act as an incubator and testing ground for the global business. Constant focus on operational excellence, the development of world class training technology and system development will all continue to benefit the global business.The three NZ-based company-owned stores have performed well, and we continue to see potential in this area. With strong cash reserves and no debt, the Group is well placed to facilitate further key BurgerFuel restaurant purchases, should opportunities arise that fit the BFW criteria for company-owned stores.While sales continue to grow year-on-year, the board notes that the market should expect store openings in New Zealand to slow down as this market approaches its full potential – especially in the North Island. BFW still sees the opportunity for further expansion in the South Island and this will be explored during FY18.While focus will remain on the protection andgrowth of the existing New Zealand business, BFWwill continue in its exploration of diversification opportunities. The board will be considering all options for continued expansion within the New Zealand Market, both inside and outside the BurgerFuel brand.The Australian market remains difficult, and alongside an extremely competitive landscape, we continue to face high operating costs such as rent and labour.Sales and royalty income derived from Australia has seen a reduction in comparison to FY16, due to the reduced store numbers, and a move to sourcing locally produced products, rather than exporting from NZ.In the long term, this move will improve profitability for the Group and the remaining franchised Australian stores.As we seek to explore new markets in new countries our strategy has always incorporated our ability to both open and if necessary close or re-locate locations if the need arises. In early FY18, the franchised Parramatta store in Sydney was closed due to a less than expected trading performance. This will have no material impact on BFW results.As previously communicated, we are aware that it will require significant time and investment to establish the brand to a profitable level in Australia.At this stage we will continue to operate in the Australian market but it remains under review and accordingly monthly performance will be closely monitored with view to our long term commitment to Australia.MIDDLE EASTERN REGIONIn the Middle East, despite facing the ongoing effects of low oil prices as well as economic and political unrest, we have seen significant growth in certain areas and continue to make progress in this market.As of the 31st March 2017, we now have a total of 27 BurgerFuel stores across the Middle East.Most notably, our business in Saudi Arabia has seen significant growth in sales in the last six months,and this can be largely attributed to the recent revitalisation of the Saudi economy as well as efforts to increase marketing activity in that region.The UAE, we are facing a densely populated competitor market, with over 55 burger concepts now competing. Despite these challenges, our business in the UAE continues to operate reasonably well, and Dubai remains a strong focus for us in the Middle Eastern region.The largest problem facing all retail brands in Dubaiis the continued upward movement of occupancy costs with retail rents rising. These out of proportion occupancy costs take the shine off trading results and remove incentives to develop further. This is a trend that is occurring in nearly all developed world markets (including New Zealand) and can only lead to both the failure of some concepts as well as the increased ticket prices of all retail goods sold in store, including food.In Egypt, we relocated a store in September 2016. While we remain optimistic about this market, the reality is that due to ongoing political turmoil, store turnover is very low and this market will requireclose monitoring. Our partners continue to look for expansion opportunities in Egypt and have our support in this endeavour.In Iraq, where we have one store in Baghdad, sales are strong, and our partners are actively looking at expansion opportunities.In summary, while revenue is down for the MENA region, it continues to be a good contributor for us, despite heavy competition, regional unrest and the economic effects of lower oil prices. We do caution the market every year that our outlook in any of these regions can change quickly due to the ongoing potential for volatility in the Middle East. As such, we will monitor all of these markets closely.GROUP OUTLOOKDespite withdrawing from the collaboration agreement with Franchise Brands last year, in May 2017 we announced the opening of the first BurgerFuel storein the United States, located in Indianapolis. This is a 100% company owned and operated store.Although it is early days, the store is operating well, and the initial public reaction has been extremely positive. The focus is now on ensuring the continued growth of this store, monitoring performance closely and preparing for further expansion in the American market.Outside of the US, the group continues to protect and grow the existing business, as well as look for new expansion opportunities both inside and outside of the BurgerFuel brand.Despite significant investment into the USA, cash reserves have increased, and BFW is in a strong position, not only financially, but also from a management, resource and intellectual property perspective. This places the Group in good stead for both further expansion and diversification into new opportunities.The Board will be considering all options for the expansion of the Group both in New Zealand and internationally. In this regard, and as always, we will keep the market informed of any progress made.The Group has no debt, and as of 31st March 2017 had cash reserves of $6.4M.We would like to thank all our shareholders for their continued support, and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. 31 March 2017 $000 22,343 (21,229)1,114889*** Expenses include; Operating expenses, depreciation, amortisation & interest expenseBest regardsPeter Brook Chairman Operating Revenue* Operating Expenses**Net Profit (Loss) Before Tax Net Profit (Loss) After Tax31 March 2016 $000 20,328 (21,374)(1,046)(1,144)Josef Roberts Group CEO   Revenue includes; Operating revenue & interest income. PAGE 3PAGE 4

BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 PAGE 7  BURGERFUEL OPENS IN THE USAAfter ending our collaboration agreement with Franchise Brands last year, we forged ahead in true BurgerFuel style, in May 2017 we opened an independent, company owned store in Indianapolis, USA.The flagship restaurant is located on a large stand-alone site in thriving Broad Ripple, a suburb filled with bars, clubs, eateries as well as four large universities. The area, which can be likened to the Auckland suburb of Ponsonby, attracts a lively crowd who travel there for the high energy social scene on offer.In order to give the people of Indianapolis a full throttle introduction to the iconic BurgerFuel experience, launch activity included the full arsenal of BurgerFuel culture, from live street art installations in the community, to Radio BurgerFuel broadcasting live from the store and our two classic, custom-built BurgerFuel machines cruising the streets of Indianapolis.Serving up the same fresh, natural, gourmet burgers and unique sides that are loved by customers around the globe, the store has performed well to date, and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.We are now fully focused on the performance of this store, with our sights set firmly on further expansion in the USA.      PAGE 8

This has not impaired our independence.Key Audit MattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Key audit matters are selected from the matters communicated with the Directors, but are not intended to represent all matters that were discussed with them.Key Audit MatterHow our audit addressed the key audit matterAcquisition of Takapuna FranchiseOur audit procedures among others included:As disclosed in Note 29 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements the Group Acquired the Takapuna Franchise during the year ended 31 March 2017. The acquisition was significant to our audit due to the size of the acquisition (consideration transferred of $1,298,067) and the subjectivity and complexity inherent in the business acquisition.• Reading the sale and purchase agreement relating to the acquisition to understand key terms and conditions and confirming our understanding of the transaction with Management.Management has completed a process to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, measure the consideration transferred, and allocate the consideration transferred to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values.• Evaluating the identified assets and liabilities against the terms of the sale and purchase agreement.This process involves complex and subjective estimation and judgement by Management on the following:• the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities at acquisition date; and• the accounting treatment of the acquisition;• the cash flow forecasts used in the measurement of the identifiable intangible assets, which included assessing the appropriateness of future cash flow forecasts and discount rates applied to those forecasts against the historic performance of the business and considering the impact and likelihood of known future events.• identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed;• the future performance of the acquired business;• discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts; and• Evaluating the related disclosures about the acquisition of the Takapuna Franchise included in Note 29 in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.• determination of the goodwill balance.Management has 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the purchase price allocation. Management are currently in the process of obtaining a valuation of the reacquired rights to finalise this process, as disclosed in Note 29.• Evaluating the measurement of the consideration transferred.• For the measurement of the identified assets and liabilities, evaluating:

Goodwill was significant to our audit due to the size of the assets and the subjectivity, complexity and uncertainty inherent in the measurement of the recoverable amount of the CGUs’ for the purpose of the required annual impairment test. The measurement of a CGUs recoverable amount includes the assessment and calculation of its ‘value-in-use’.• Evaluating Management’s determination of the Group’s two CGUs based on our understandingof the nature of the Group’s business and the economic environment in which the segments operate. We also analysed the internal reporting of the Group to assess how CGUs are monitored and reported.Management has completed the annual impairment test for each of the CGUs as at 31 March 2017.• Challenging Management’s assumptions and estimates used to determine the recoverable value of its indefinite life intangible assets, including those relating to forecast revenue, cost, capital expenditure, discount rates, by adjusting for future events and corroborating the key market related assumptions to external data, Procedures included:The Group is still finalising its purchase price allocation for the Takapuna acquisition. It is expected that a value will be attributed to the reacquired rights which will be amortised over a residual 9.5 year term. The balance after allocation to the reacquired rights would be allocated to Goodwill. In the current year the total Goodwill balance has been included for impairment testing.• Evaluating the logic of the value-in-use calculations supporting their annual impairment test and testing the mathematical accuracy of these calculations;• Evaluating Management’s process regarding the preparation and review of forecasts;• Comparing forecasts to Board approved forecasts;• Evaluating the historical accuracy ofthe Group’s forecasting to actual historical performance;• Evaluating the forecast growth assumptions;• Evaluating the inputs to the calculation of the discount rates applied;• Engaging our own internal valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of the discount rates applied;• Evaluating Management’s sensitivityanalysis’ for reasonably possible changes in key assumptions;• Performing our own sensitivity analysis for reasonably possible changes in key assumptions, the two main assumptions being: the discount rate and forecast growth assumptions (during both the forecast and terminal periods); and• Evaluating the related disclosures about indefinite life intangible assets which are included in Note 14 in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.Key Audit MatterHow our audit addressed the key audit matterRevenue RecognitionOur procedures among others included:The Group’s three largest revenue streams are, revenue from the sale of goods $10,765,657, royalties of $5,713,461 and advertising fees $3,679,221. Revenue recognised from royalties and advertising fees is calculated based on agreed percentages of sales made by the Group’s individual franchisees during the year.• Agreeing the percentage of sales due from the Group’s individual franchisees as royalties and advertising fees to the relevant franchisee agreement on a sample basis;To determine the amount of royalties and advertising fee to be recognised for the year, Management has completed royalty and advertising fee calculations throughout the year based on the percentages agreed with individual franchisees and sales information provided by these franchisees.• Evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls over the integrity, accuracy and completeness of the sales information provided to the Group by individual franchisees;Other InformationThe Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the informationOther Informationincluded in the Group’s annual report for the year ended 31 March 2017 (but does not include the consolidatedThe Directors are responsible for the other information.

     PAGE 15PAGE 16Responsibilities of the Directors for the Consolidated Financial StatementsThe Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial StatementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (NZ), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.• Conclude on the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the Directors and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to eventsor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s reportto the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.O tr eI nidd eGrp ’sicdud aui toDirtTirenomLedw2esnnlualst am enfi’ sOdIroda  nnts,or eoocdoo rmamhWeiThrmtfrc inlun ith eo unaonorlmupino.otndrfincsmyd• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter shouldnot be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.Matters Relating to the Electronic Presentation of the Audited Consolidated Financial StatementsThis audit report relates to the consolidated financial statements of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 March 2017 included on Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited’s website.

A list of its wholly owned subsidiaries is listed in note 12 of the financial statements.The Group operates as a franchisor of gourmet burger restaurants and is a for-profit oriented entity, incorporated and domiciled in New Zealand.2) BASIS OF PREPARATIONStatement of ComplianceThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“NZ GAAP”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 1993, the Financial ReportingAct 2013 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. They comply with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (“NZ IFRS”), and other applicable Financial Reporting Standardsas appropriate for, for-profit oriented entities. For the purposes of complying with NZ GAAP, the Group is a Tier 1 for-profit entity as defined in the XRB’s Accounting Standards Framework. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars ($), which is the Company’s functional currency and they have been rounded to the nearest dollar.The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on the date set out on page 19 of the Annual Report.Basis of MeasurementThese financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities in specific accounting policies below.Use of Estimates and JudgementsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with NZ IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of judgments in preparing these financial statements are set out below:Impairment of ReceivablesThe Group maintains an allowance for estimated losses expected to arise from customers being unable to make required payments. This allowance takes into account known commercial factors impacting specific customer accounts, as well as the overall profile of the Group’s debtors’ portfolio. In assessing the allowance, factors such as past collection history, the age of receivable balances, the level of activity in customer accounts, as well as general, macro-economic trends, are taken into account. The impairment of receivables is detailed in note 9 of the financial statements.Accounting for Income TaxPreparation of the annual financial statements requires management to make estimates as to, amongst other things, the amount of tax that will ultimately be payable, the availability of losses to be carried forward and the amount of foreign tax credits it will receive in each of the jurisdictions it operates in.Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses (where applicable) only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of reassessment by management or taxation authorities.Refer to note 7 for additional information on accounting for income tax.Impairment of GoodwillThe Group reviews Goodwill for indicators of impairment at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the fair value of the cash-generating units to which the Goodwill are allocated. Estimating the fair value amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit in the forecasted period and also to determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The Group’s longer term forecasts are subject to a higher level of uncertaintyas it mostly depends on consumer spending, market conditions and level of competition. For additional information on the impairment test, reference is made to note 14.1 - Intangible Assets.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe following is a summary of specific accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements that materially affect the measurement of financial performance, cash flows and the financial position.      20172016 22,934,67119,294,725126,453198,2047,91895,10423,069,04219,588,033 26(20,374,689) (19,945,381) (6,918) (4,350) (107,015) (363,320)(20,488,622) (20,313,051)140,419 115,475186,419 161,475(195,180) (308,299) (133,000) -(814,513) (949,171) (1,298,067) -(2,440,760) (1,257,470)326,079 (1,821,013) 8,528 178,268 6,078,288 7,721,03346,000 46,000   2917  (2,254,341) (1,095,995)6,412,8956,078,288The attached notes form part of these financial statements PAGE 21PAGE 222,580,420(725,018)
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017                              3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)a) Basis of ConsolidationSubsidiariesSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is thefair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair valueof any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companiesare eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.b) Revenue RecognitionRevenue shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises those amounts received and receivable for goods and services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.Sale of GoodsRevenue from the sale of goods is measured at thefair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, allowances and discounts. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs of possible return of goods can be estimated reliably and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods.Franchise FeesFranchise fees (incorporating master franchise fees) for the provision of continuing services, whether part of the initial fee or a separate fee, are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for otherservices provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.RoyaltiesRoyalty income is recorded when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Training FeesTraining fee income is recognised as the twelve week training course is provided to the new operator.Advertising IncomeAdvertising income is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and amounts can be reliably measured. It is calculated on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Franchise or Master Licence Agreement.Construction Management FeesConstruction management fees are recognised on a percentage of completion basis, as the store build progresses.DividendsDividend income is recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the right to receive the dividend is established.Other IncomeAll other income is recognised when significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer, there is loss of effective control by the seller and the amount and costs can be reliably measured.c) Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment is established where there is objective evidence the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter into bankruptcy, or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payment (more than 30 days overdue) are considered objective evidence of impairment. Bad debts are written off during the period in which they are identified. If these debts are subsequently collected then a gain is recognised in profit or loss.3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)d) InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after due consideration for excess and obsolete items. Cost is based on the first in, first out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing condition and location. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.e) Financial InstrumentsThe Group has the option to classify its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets / liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loansand receivables, held to maturity investments, available for sale financial assets and other financial liabilities. Management determines the classification on initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. At balance date all of the Group’s financial assets were classified as loans and receivables.Loans and ReceivablesLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are thereafter carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.Other Financial LiabilitiesThese amounts represent unsecured liabilities forgoods and services provided to the Group prior tothe end of the financial year which are unpaid. Other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s other financial liabilities are trade and other payables, and these are usually paid within 30 days.f) Share CapitalOrdinary SharesIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.g) Finance Income and ExpenseFor all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income and expense is recorded at the effective interest rate.h) Property, Plant and EquipmentRecognition and MeasurementItems of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self- constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributableto bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.Subsequent CostsThe cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amountof the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The following depreciation rates have been used:Motor VehiclesLeasehold ImprovementsInformation TechnologyFurniture & Fittings Kitchen Equipment Office Equipment16% - 36% diminishing value & straight line (USA)9% - 26.4% diminishing value & straight line (USA)33% - 67% diminishing value & straight line (USA)10% - 80.4% diminishing value 13% - 39.6% diminishing value10% - 60% diminishing value & straight line (USA)Where an asset is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the carrying amount of the asset. PAGE 23PAGE 24
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017                              3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)i) Leased AssetsOperating and Financing LeasesOperating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the periods the amounts are payable in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis.j) Intangible AssetsThe Group’s intangible assets have finite useful lives with the exception of Goodwill and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. The intangible assets are amortised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the period during which benefits are expected to be derived, which is up to 10 years. Where there has been an impairment in the value, the balance has been written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.As part of a business combination, an acquirer may acquire a right that it had previously granted to the acquiree to use one or more of the acquirer’s recognised or unrecognised assets. An example of such rights include a right to use the acquirer’s trade name under a franchise agreement. A reacquired right is an identifiable intangible asset that the acquirer recognises separately from goodwill. Reacquired rights are initially valued at the present value of the expected future cash flows, which is subsequently used as cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life, being the remaining contractual period without considering contractual extension possibilities, but not exceeding 10 years.k) Employee BenefitsShort-term BenefitsShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.The Group pays contributions to superannuation plans, such as KiwiSaver. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.l) TaxationIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss.Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.Deferred tax is provided using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amountsof assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.m) Goods and Services Tax (GST)The Statement of Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows has been prepared so that all components are stated exclusive of GST. All items in the Statementof Financial Position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables, which include GST invoiced. The operations of the Group comprise both exempt and non-exempt supplies for GST purposes.n) Foreign CurrencyForeign Currency TransactionsTransactions in foreign currencies are translated intothe functional currencies of the entities within theGroup at exchange rates at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss.Foreign OperationsThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are3) SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)translated to New Zealand dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated to New Zealand dollars at the average exchange rates for the period where this rate approximates the rate at the date of the transaction.Foreign currency differences are recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR). When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.o) Statement of Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bankand call deposits net of bank overdrafts. Investing activities comprise the purchase and sale of fixedassets, acquisition of a subsidiary and intangible assets along with any funding made available or repaid from franchisees. Financing activities comprise any changes in equity and debt and the payment of dividends (if any). Operating activities include all transactions and other events that are not investing or financing activities.p) Earnings and Net Tangible Assets Per ShareThe Group presents basic and diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes share options granted to employees.The Group also presents Net Tangible Assets Per Share for its ordinary shares and it is calculated by dividing the net tangible assets of the Group by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the year.q) Segment ReportingOperating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision maker; being the Board of Directors.The Group operates in four operating segments – these consist of the following geographical locations, New Zealand, Australia, United States of America and the Middle East.There have been no changes from prior years in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss.r) GoodwillGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.Refer to Note 14.1 for a description of impairment testing procedures.s) Impairment testing of Goodwill, Other intangible Assets and Non-financial AssetsFor impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units).As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated (determined by the Group’s management as equivalent to its operating segments) are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.The data used for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group’s latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined individually for each cash- generating unit and reflect management’s assessment of respective risk profiles, such as market and asset- specific risks factors.The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Impairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the carrying amount of any Goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of Goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. An impairment charge is reversed if the cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount. PAGE 25PAGE 26

Instead, there is a single lessee model which requires a lessee to recognise on the statement of financial position assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.NZ IFRS 16 will impact the Groups Statement of Financial Position as they hold the head leases on all the New Zealand franchised & company owned stores. The value of the lease will be capitalised on the balance sheet with a liability offset to reflect the lease with the franchisee.The accounting requirements for lessors are substantially the same as those in NZ IAS 17. A lessor, therefore, continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and continues to account for those two types of leases differently.NZ IFRS 16 applies to Tier 1 and Tier 2 for-profit reporting entities, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.The Group intends to adopt NZ IFRS 16 on its effective date and has yet to assess its full effect.                              4) NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTEDAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:NZ IFRS 9 – Financial instruments (effective date from 1 January 2018)NZ IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.These requirements improve and simplify the approach for classification and measurement of financial assets compared with the requirements of NZ IAS 39. The main changes are:(a) Financial assets that are debt instrumentswill be classified based on (1) the objective of the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets; and (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.(b) Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on investments in equity instruments that arenot held for trading in other comprehensive income (instead of in profit or loss). Dividends in respect of these investments that are a return on investment can be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or recycling on disposal of the instrument.(c) Introduces a ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ measurement category for particular simple debt instruments.(d) Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.(e) Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities the change in fair value is to be accounted for as follows:• The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (OCI); and• The remaining change is presented in profit or loss.If this approach creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch in the profit or loss, the effect of the changes in credit risk are also presented in profit or loss.Otherwise, the following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from NZ IAS 39 into NZ IFRS 9• Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and• Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities.NZ IFRS 9 requirements regarding hedge accounting represent a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting that will enable entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial statements.NZ IFRS 9 also contains a new impairment model based on expected credit losses. The model makes use of more forward-looking information. In applying this more forward-looking approach, a distinction is made between:• Financial instruments that have deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition and whose credit risk is not low.The Group intends to adopt NZ IFRS 9 on its effective date and has yet to assess its full impact. Management does not expect a significant change to the way in which the group measures its financial instruments.NZ IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (effective date from 1 January 2018)NZ IFRS •• •••15:replaces NZ IAS 18 Revenue, NZ IAS 11 Construction Contracts and some revenue- related interpretations.establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model.changes the basis for deciding whether revenue is to be recognised over time or at a point in timeprovides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics.expands and improves disclosures about revenue.In particular, NZ IFRS 15 includes important new guidance on:• contracts involving the delivery of two or more goods or services – when to account separately for the individual performance obligations in a multiple element arrangement, how to allocate the transaction price, and when to combine contracts timing – whether revenue is required to be recognised over time or at a single point in time.• variable pricing and credit risk – addressing how to treat arrangements with variable or contingent (e.g. performance-based) pricing, and introducing an overall constraint on revenue. PAGE 27PAGE 28

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201714.1) Impairment testingImpairmentBased on the impairment testing results, no impairment loss on Goodwill is recorded in the 2017 financial year. In assessing impairment, management estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or cash-generating unit based on expected future cash flows and uses an interest rate to discount to present values. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about future operating results and the determination of a suitable discount rate.For the purpose of annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the following cash-generating units, which are the units expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations in which the Goodwill arises.The full amount of goodwill has been impairment tested although upon completion of the acquisition accounting an amount will be allocated to reacquired rights.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017                          15) TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLESTrade payables Payroll liabilities GST payable Accrued expenses$$ 201720161,693,489 25,391 199,223 203,0391,196,568 79,458 191,305 60,3582,121,1421,527,689 20172016New Zealand Retail – Henderson Store New Zealand Retail – Takapuna Store Goodwill allocation at 31 March$ 1,188,612 -Payables denominated in currencies other than the presentation currency comprise 8.83% of the trade payables (2016: 5.38%).$701,427 701,427 1,890,039701,42716) PROVISIONSStore Closure ProvisionOpening balanceProvisions made during the year Provisions used during the yearHoliday Pay ProvisionOpening balanceProvisions made during the year Provisions used during the yearTotal Provisions 20172016The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units were determined based on value-in-use calculations, covering a detailed five-year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows for the units’ remaining useful lives using the growth rates determined by management.

The Group’s management believes that this is the best available input for forecasting this mature market. Cash flow projections reflect stable profit margins achieved immediately before the budget period. No expected efficiency improvements have been taken into account and prices and wages reflect publicly available forecasts of inflation for the industry.The Group have used different discount and growth rates to determine the value-in-use of the cash-generating units and have concluded that there has been no indication of impairment loss in Goodwill value. An increase of 3% in Discount with no increase in Growth rate from the 2017 year would still not have generated impairment loss.Apart from the considerations described in determining the value-in-use of the cash-generating units described above, management is not currently aware of any other probable changes that would necessitate changes in its key estimates.Current 337,023 Non-current 35,650 Total ProvisionsStore Closure Provision337,023307,219372,673341,669372,673341,669This is the make good provision that is set aside to cover the costs of returning premises that are occupied by BurgerFuel back to their original condition, after taking into account the normal wear and tear of these premises.Holiday Pay ProvisionThis is the allocation of the 8% annual leave entitlement that each full-time and part-time employee is entitled to as part of their employment, which is accrued throughout the year. PAGE 41PAGE 42

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201721) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)Financial Risk Management ObjectivesManagement provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.The Management reports quarterly to the Group’s audit committee, who monitors risk and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.Market RiskThe Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk exposures are analysed by sensitivity analysis. There has not been significant change to BurgerFuel’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.Foreign currency risk managementThe Group’s foreign exchange risk is limited to its US dollar, Australian Dollar & UAE Dirham bank accounts and the trading of its Australian, US & United Arab Emirates subsidiary’s. It maintains amounts in these foreign bank accounts and transfers funds when foreign exchange rates are favourable.Foreign currency sensitivity analysisThe Group is mainly exposed to Australian dollars, US Dollars and UAE Dirhams. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the NZ$ against the Australian, UAE & USA currency. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201721) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)Interest Rate RiskThe Group has cash flow interest rate risk from financial instruments that attract interest. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the Group’s assets and liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its cash balances and advances.The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining minimal variable rate cash balances. Excess cash resources are placed into fixed rate term deposits where appropriate.                          Interest rate risk profile2017Financial AssetsCash and cash equivalent Advance to SupplierTrade and other receivablesFinancial LiabilitiesTrade payables2016Financial AssetsCash and cash equivalent Loans to FranchiseesTrade and other receivablesFinancial LiabilitiesTrade payables$$$ Weighted average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon - interest bearingTotal1.14% 6,412,895 - 3.00% 133,000 - - - 2,568,981- 2,121,1426,412,895 133,000 2,568,9812,121,1426,545,8952,568,9819,114,876-2,121,1422,121,142GROUPProfit / (Loss) EquityInterest rate sensitivity analysis$000 $000(2) 28 (1) 20$000 $0003 (31) 2 (31)$$$2.34% 6,078,288 - 6,078,288 - - 46,000 46,000 - - 2,482,842 2,482,842- - 1,527,689 1,527,689 10%Strengthening10%Weakening2017201620172016 Weighted average effective interest rate %Less than 1 yearNon - interest bearingTotal6,078,2882,528,8428,607,130The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance datewas outstanding for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.The Group has a USD overdraft facility and has exposure to floating interest rates on this facility. This USD overdraft facility has an effect on the interest paid on the Group’s cash and cash equivalent accounts.If the interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s operating result for the year ended 31 March 2017 would have been $64,129 higher (2016: $60,782 higher).-1,527,6891,527,689 PAGE 45PAGE 46
 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201721) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk that the counter party to a transaction with the Group will fail to discharge its obligations, causing the Group to incur a financial loss. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored by management and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, trade debtors, loans and advances.The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. The maximum credit risk exposures are:NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201722) COMMITMENTSLease CommitmentsOperating leases relate to the store leases.

The Group holds the head lease over all of its franchisee sites with the exception of the Australia stores and in turn licenses each of these sites to its franchisees under the same terms and conditions. At balance date, the total value of lease commitments under this arrangement was $3,623,462 (2016: $3,043,526).Capital CommitmentsAt 31 March 2017, the Group has a contractual commitment to purchase 61 Ice cream machines ($1.2M), it is the Groups intention for these to be on-sold to the franchisees (2016: Nil).Maximum exposures are net of any recognised provisions, and at balance date no loans or advances are past due or considered to be impaired (2016: $Nil). Receivables of $120,583 are impaired with no further amounts past due (2016: $634,362 past due).CashThe Group’s major concentration of credit risk relates to cash deposits with ASB Limited in New Zealand, CBA Bank Limited in Australia & Bank of America Merrill Lynch & Huntington Bank in the USA.ReceivablesThe Group has a credit policy, which is used to manage its exposure to credit risk. As part of this policy, limits on exposures have been set, lending is subject to defined criteria and loans are monitored on a regular basis. The trade receivable are payable on the 10th of the following month and loans are subject a loan agreement which stipulates monthly repayments or payable on demand. No security is held.Capital ManagementThe Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Statements of Financial Position. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the required capital structure the Group may issue new shares, sell assets to reduce debt and/or adjust amounts paid to investors.The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. The Group maintains sufficient funds to meet the commitments based on historical and forecasted cash flow requirements. The exposure is being reviewed on an ongoing basis from daily procedures to monthly reporting.Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. All payables are due within 6 months of balance date (2016: 6 months).The Group expects to meet its obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets.Indemnity / GuaranteesBurgerFuel has deposits in place to cover certain commitments the banks have provided: 20172016Total future minimum paymentsTotal future minimum paymentsNZX BondBond for Newtown PremisesBond for Australian Kitchen Premises23) CONTINGENCIESThe Group has no contingencies at balance date (2016: Nil).20,000 31,965 10,95120,000 32,483 11,129$$62,91663,612 PAGE 47PAGE 48

The acquisition was made to enhance the Group’s position in the fast food restaurant market. Burger Fuel Takapuna is a significant business in the Group’s targeted market.NOTES TO THECONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201730) NET TANGIBLE ASSET PER SHAREThe net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the net tangible assets of the Group by the total number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.                           20172016The details of the business combination are as follows:Fair value of consideration transferredAmount settled in cashTotalRecognised amounts of identifiable net assetsProperty, plant and equipmentTotal non-current assetsInventoriesTotal current assetsIdentifiable net assetsGoodwill on acquisitionConsideration transferred settled in cashNet cash outflow on acquisitionAcquisition costs charged to expensesNet cash paid relating to the acquisitionConsideration transferredThe acquisition of Burger Fuel Takapuna Limited was settled in cash of $1,298,067.Identifiable net assetsThe fair value of the all assets acquired as part of the business combination amounted to $110,211.Goodwill$$ 1,298,0671,298,067102,588102,5886,8676,867109,4551,188,6121,298,0671,298,067Nil1,298,067Total AssetsLess Intangible Assets Total Tangible Assets Total LiabilitiesNet Tangible AssetsTotal ordinary shares on issueNet Tangible Assets per share ($ per Share)16,151,363 (2,518,940)13,632,423 (2,519,163)11,113,260 59,633,5500.1914,609,045 (1,204,285)13,404,760 (1,869,358)11,535,402 59,633,5500.19  Goodwill of $1,188,612 is primarily related to growth expectations, expected future profitability, the substantial skill and expertise of Burger Fuel Takapuna Limited’s workforce and expected cost synergies. Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units at 31 March 2017. The goodwill that arose from this business combination is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Until the reacquired right has been determined the total amount has been allocated to goodwill.Reacquired RightsThe acquisition of the Takapuna franchised store remains an open transaction (as we are still within the measurement period) at balance date due to the franchise agreement having 9.5 years remaining, at time of acquisition. An independent valuation to assess the value of the reacquired right is still to be completed. The reacquired right portion of the goodwill amount will be amortised over the residual life of the franchise. This will not have a material effect on the current year financial statements.Burger Fuel Takapuna Limited’s contribution to the Group resultsBurger Fuel Takapuna Limited generated a before tax profit of $113,905 for the six month period ending 31 March 2017. If Burger Fuel Takapuna Limited had been acquired on 1 April 2016, revenue of the Group for 2017 would have been $23,113,119 and profit for the year would have increased by $142,129. PAGE 53PAGE 54

 BURGER FUEL WORLDWIDE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2017  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017Directors & Officers Board & Audit Committee Attendance RecordPeter Brook (Chair) Josef RobertsChris MasonAlan DunnJohn PfannenbeckerOfficersTyrone Foley (Chief Operating Officer)Mark Piet (Chief Financial Officer / Company Secretary)ConstitutionA full copy of the Company’s constitution is available on the Company’s website (www.burgerfuel.com).Board RemunerationDirectors are entitled to Directors’ fees, reasonable travelling, accommodation and other expenses incurred in the course of performing duties or exercising powers as Directors. Aggregate fees payable to the Board will not exceed $180,000 per annum, excluding the Group Chief Executive, CEO International Markets, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer/Company Secretary.Peter Brook, the Chairman, receives an annual fee of $70,000 and Alan Dunn the independent, non-executive Director receives an annual fee of $50,000. The Company Secretary attends to all company secretarial and corporate governance matters.Conflict of InterestThe Board has guidelines dealing with the disclosure of interests by Directors and the participation and voting at Board meetings where any such interests are discussed. The Group maintains an interests register in which particulars of certain transactions and matters involving Directors must be recorded.                            The Board of Directors is responsible for the corporate governance of the Group. “Corporate Governance” involves the direction and control of the businessby the Directors and the accountability of Directorsto shareholders and other stakeholders for the performance of the Group and compliance with applicable laws and standards.Role of the BoardThe Board is elected by the Shareholders of the Company. At each Annual Meeting one third of the directors will retire by rotation. The Directors to retire are those who wish to retire, or those who have been longest in office since last being elected.The Board of Directors is responsible for the overall direction of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited’s business and affairs on behalf of all shareholders. The Board’s key role is to ensure that corporate managementis continuously and effectively striving for above- average performance, taking account of risk.The Board:• Establishes the objectives of Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited;• Approves major strategies for achieving these objectives;• Oversees risk management and compliance;• Sets in place the policy framework within which BurgerFuel operates; and• Monitors management performance against this background.The Board has delegated the day-to-day leadership and management of the Group to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.The Board monitors financial results and compares them to annual plans and forecasts / budgets on a regular basis, and on a quarterly basis reviews the Group’s performance against its strategic planning objectives.Board size and CompositionUnlike the NZX Listing Rules for NZSX listed companies, the NZAX Listing Rules do not require that the Company have any independent directors. However, in the interests of good governance, and notwithstanding that there is no requirement under the NZAX Listing Rules, the Directors have decided to adopt a governance policy whereby at least two of the Directors of the Board will be “independent” as defined in the NZX Listing Rules. The size and composition of the Board is determined by the Company’s constitution. As at 31 March 2017, there were five Directors, a Chief Operating Officer, and a Chief Financial Officer / Company Secretary.The Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee are non-executive and independent of the role of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.Audit CommitteeAlthough not required by the NZAX Listing Rules, to assist the Board in the execution of its responsibilities, an Audit Committee is in operation.(i) Risk ManagementThe Audit Committee is required to establish a framework of internal control mechanisms to ensure proper management of the Group’s affairs and that key business and financial risks are identified and controls and procedures are in place to effectively manage those risks. The Audit Committee is accountable to the Board for the recommendation of the external auditors, directing and monitoring the audit function and reviewing the adequacy and quality of the annual audit process(ii) Additional AssuranceThe Committee provides the Board with additional assurance regarding the accuracy of financial information for inclusion in the Group’s annual report, including the financial statements. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring that Burger Fuel Worldwide Limited has an effective internal control framework. These controls include the safeguarding of assets, maintaining proper accounting records, complying with legislation, including resource management and health and safety issues, ensuring the reliability of financial information and assessing and overviewing business risk. The Committee also deals with governmental and New Zealand Stock Exchange requirements.(iii) Share Trading PolicyThe Company has adopted a formal Securities Trading Policy (“Policy”) to address insider trading requirements under the Securities Markets Act 1988 (as amendedby the Securities Markets Amendment Act 2006 and the Securities Markets Regulations 2007). The Policyis modelled on the Listed Companies Association Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines and is administered by the Audit Committee and restricts share trading in a number of ways.(iv) Insurance and IndemnificationBurger Fuel Worldwide Limited provides indemnity insurance cover to directors, officers and employees of the Group except where there is conduct involving a wilful breach of duty, improper use of inside information or criminality.6 3 6 3 5 - 6 3 2 -5 3 6 3 DirectorsBoard MeetingsAudit Committee Meetings  PAGE 59Four macroenvironmental trends are contributing to an increased focus on health and wellness: an aging global population; rising chronic-disease rates; a rise in self-care, treatment and prevention; and increasingly educated and connected consumers.Food sensitivities also are in uencing food preferences. More than one-third (36%) of global survey respondents say they have an allergy or intolerance to one or more foods, and retail sales data has shown strong growth for products catering to food sensitivities in the U.K., Germany and the U.S.Nearly two-thirds of global respondents (64%) say they follow a diet that limits or prohibits consumption of some foods or ingredients, with response rates in Africa/Middle East (84%) and Asia-Paci c (72%) higher than average.Retail sales data shows that consumers are cutting back on certain foods that are typically high in fat, sugar or sodium, but there remains a place for indulgences in consumers’ diets, particularly more healthful treats.Consumers are adopting a back-to-basics mind-set, focusing on simple ingredients and fewer processed foods. More than half of consumers say they’re avoiding arti cial ingredients, hormones or antibiotics, genetically modi ed organisms (GMOs) and bisphenol A (BPA).There is a clear opportunity to better serve consumers’ dietary needs. Among respondents who say they have a food sensitivity or follow a special diet, fewer than half (45%) believe their needs are being fully met by current product o erings.Almost anyone you ask will tell you that eating a healthful diet is important—a sentiment that isn’t new. So why is there a seemingly heightened focus on clean eating? A contributing factor is the convergence of several macroenvironmental forces:••Global graying. The world’s population is aging rapidly (though at a slower rate in some parts of the world, including Africa and parts of Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean) and living longer. The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that over the next 35 years, the growth of the world’s older population will outpace that of the younger population.Chronically ailing. Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, respiratory diseases and cancer, are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and incidences are on the rise globally. According to the World Health Organization,
 chronic disease is expected to account for 73% of deaths globally by 2020, up from roughly 60% in 2001. Almost three-quarters of global deaths attributable to chronic disease occur in low- and middle- income countries. Medical experts agree that these illnesses are largely preventable, and as rates continue to climb, the need for the behavior modification to prevent and manage them is widely recognized.• Food as medicine. Consumers are taking a more active role in their health care, which includes following proper nutrition guidelines to prevent or manage many health issues. In fact, 70% of global respondents in Nielsen’s Global Health and Ingredient-Sentiment Survey say they actively make dietary choices to help prevent health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension.• Educated and connected consumers. Technology gives consumers access to a wealth of health information and products they canuse to exercise greater control over their health. And consumersare demanding greater transparency from food manufacturers and retailers. Only 44% of global respondents in Nielsen’s survey strongly or somewhat agree that they trust industrially prepared foods (those produced by food companies), and nearly three-quarters (73%) agree that they feel more positively about companies that are transparent about where and how products were made, raised or grown.“Consumers want to eat more healthfully, but they can’t do it alone,”said Andrew Mandzy, Director of Strategic Health and Wellness Insights, Nielsen. “They need help from food manufacturers to offer products that are formulated with good-for-you ingredients. They need help from retailers to stock shelves with right-priced healthful assortment. And they need help from the medical community to provide proper guidance on what and how much to eat in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.”Helping consumers eat more healthfully may also drive healthier bottom lines for manufacturers and retailers. Two-thirds of global respondents (68%) strongly or somewhat agree they’re willing to pay more for foods and drinks that don’t contain undesirable ingredients. An analysis of U.S. retail sales data supports this notion: While total fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales volume has been flat over the past four years, sales of products with health and wellness claims are outpacing total category growth by a significant margin in many categories.The Nielsen Global Health and Ingredient-Sentiment Survey polled more than 30,000 online respondents in 63 countries to understand how consumers feel about the foods and beverages available on store shelves. We examined respondents’ self-reported dietary restrictions, including food allergies or intolerances, and the extent to which current offerings are meeting their needs. We also looked at consumer sentiment across 22 different ingredients to uncover what consumers want on store shelves. ABOUT THE GLOBAL SURVEY METHODOLOGYThe findings in this survey are based on respondents with online access in 63 countries (unless otherwise noted). While an online survey methodology allows for tremendous scale and global reach, it providesa perspective on the habits of only existing internet users, not total populations. In developing markets where online penetration is still growing, respondents may be younger and more affluent than the general population of that country.In addition, survey responses are based on claimed behavior, rather than actual metered data. Cultural differences in reporting sentiment are likely factors in the outlook across countries. The reported results do not attempt to control or correct for these differences; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing across countries and regions, particularly across regional boundaries.Where noted, the survey researchis supplemented with purchasing behavior using Nielsen’s Retail Measurement Services and Wellness Track data.  Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 5
 6GLOBAL INGREDIENT AND OUT-OF-HOME DINING TRENDS REPORTDRIVEN BY DISCOMFORT: SENSITIVE STOMACHSIt’s not just chronic diseases that are on the rise. Research fromthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) shows that food allergy rates are rising in developed countries worldwide. In fact, the CDC found that food allergies among children increased approximately 50% between 1997 and 2011, while the EAACI found that hospital admissions for severe reactions in children have risen sevenfold over the past decade. Furthermore, Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) reports that as many as 15 million Americans have food allergies, and the EAACI estimates that 17 million Europeans are affected by allergies. And while food allergy research is not as readily available in developing markets, the literature suggests that as these markets develop, allergy rates will follow a growth pattern similar to that observed in more mature markets.The percentage of respondents who self-report a food sensitivity or intolerance also is noteworthy. Thirty-six percent of global respondents in Nielsen’s survey say they or someone in their household have an allergy or intolerance to one or more foods. Dairy or lactose and shellfish allergies are the most common self- reported food allergies or intolerances, each cited by 12% of global respondents.Nielsen retail sales data suggests that the avoidance of certain food ingredients is indeed shaping some consumers’ purchasing habits. In the U.K., volume sales1 of dairy-free products grew 21.9%, and sales of gluten- and wheat-free products grew 30.3% and 6.1%, respectively, over the 52 weeks ended June 11, 2016. In Germany, volume salesof gluten-free products also grew by double digits (34.2%) in the52 weeks ended May 8, 2016. And in the U.S., Nielsen WellnessTrack data shows that volume sales of products that included a grain-free or gluten-free claim on the package grew 75.7% and 9.5%, respectively, while sales of products with a nut-free claim grew 15.2% over the 52 weeks ended July 30, 2016. In addition, sales of products with a lactose claim (lactose-free or reduced lactose) were up 4.8%.1Volume sales data are equivalized for the U.K. and Germany. That is, unit sales were converted to a common measure (most often, kilograms) to control for differences in package size. In the U.S., volume is in terms of units.MORE THAN ONE-THIRD AROUND THE WORLD SAY NO THANKS TO CERTAIN FOODSPERCENTAGE WHO SAY THEY OR SOMEONE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD SUFFERS FROM A FOOD ALLERGY OR INTOLERANCE36%GLOBAL50%AFRICA/ MIDDLE EAST42%ASIA- PACIFIC34%LATIN AMERICA31%NORTH AMERICA22%EUROPESource: The Nielsen Global Health and Ingredient- Sentiment Survey, Q1 2016
 ENLIGHTENED EATING: INDULGING SMARTERNearly two-thirds of global respondents (64%) say they follow a dietthat limits or prohibits consumption of some foods or ingredients,and the rates are even higher in certain regions. More than eight in 10 African/Middle Eastern respondents (84%) say they follow a specialdiet that limits their consumption of selected foods, with halal the most commonly cited diet (48%). Respondents in Asia-Pacific are also more likely than the global average to say they follow a special diet (72%),and they’re most likely worldwide to say they adhere to a vegetarian diet (19% versus 14% globally). Half of North American respondents say they follow a special diet, followed by 44% of European respondents.Globally, diets that limit the amount of fat or sugar are most common (31% and 26%). Additionally, about one in five respondents say they follow a diet that limits the consumption of sodium or carbohydrates (19% each).     Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 7

 An analysis of Nielsen retail sales data in selected markets2 suggests that many consumers are indeed reducing their consumption of fat, sugar and sodium. Year over year 20163 volume sales4 of sugar declined in 10 of 14 markets in the study, with the largest declines in Austria (–9.8%), the U.K. (–7.5%), Spain (–6.3%) and Belgium (–6.1%); the trend is similar for sugar substitutes and artificial sweeteners, which declined in 13 of 14 markets. In addition, volume sales of carbonated soft drinks, chocolates and cookies or biscuits (foods typically high in sugar content) were virtually flat (less than 2% increase) or declined in 13 of 17, 13 of 17 and 10 of 16 markets in the study, respectively. Volume sales of soup, which is often high in sodium, also declined in 12 of 16 markets—many quite steeply (–14.6% in India, –13.0% in Brazil and –7.7% in the U.K.) Volume sales of carbohydrate-rich foods such as bread and pasta either were flat or saw modest declines in 8 of 12 and 14 of 17 markets, respectively.While many consumers are making dietary changes for health reasons, it’s clear that there is always room for food indulgences. For example,ice cream sales grew5 impressively in several markets, including Austria (18.3%), the Philippines (9.9%) and Poland (9.5%). The salty-snacks category also is growing in the majority of markets, with double-digit sales growth in the Netherlands (16.7%), Belgium (16.4%), Egypt (15.9%), the Philippines (12.1%) and India (11.1%).“While many consumers are taking steps to opt for better-for-you food choices, they still want to treat themselves,” said Mandzy. “Increasingly, however, they’re indulging smarter, particularly when it comes to the treats they’re consuming on a regular basis. Manufacturers that innovate by incorporating ingredients and preparation methods that improve the nutritional profile of their product portfolio will be strongly positioned to succeed.”Many consumers appear less averse to foods that have health benefits mixed with high caloric or saturated-fat content. Some better-for-you categories, such as cheese, are growing in the majority of the markets(13 of 18) included in the study. In addition, nut sales are rising rapidlyin India (14.0%), Poland (9.6%) and Portugal (9.1%). In the U.S.,Nielsen Wellness Track data shows that in several traditionally indulgent categories, products with wellness claims are outpacing total category growth. For example, volume sales of salty snacks with a natural or organic claim on the package grew 5.7% and 23.4%, respectively, over the 52 weeks ended July 30, 2016, compared with growth of 2.6% for the total category. 2Not all categories are available for all countries. See methodology for listing of countries included in each category. 3See methodology for the sales period dates for each country.4Volume sales data are equivalized. That is, unit sales were converted to a common measure (most often, kilograms) to control for differences in package size.5A category is considered to be growing when year over year sales exceed 2%. Growth less than or equal to 2% is considered flat or modest.Source: Nielsen Retail Measurement Services.

 DIETARYDIVERSITY: THEINGREDIENTS WEAVOIDWhen it comes to ingredient trends, a back-to-basics mind-set, focused on simple ingredients and fewer artificial or processed foods, is a priority for the majority.While artificial or processed ingredients are widely cited as avoided around the globe, sentiment varies slightly by region. Artificial flavors, colors and preservatives appear to be less bothersomein Latin and North America than globally, while the percentagein these regions who say they avoid sodium (49% and 47%, respectively) and sugar (39% each) exceeds the global average (41% and 34%, respectively). North American respondents are also more likely to say they avoid monosodium glutamate (MSG; 55% versus 49% globally). In fact, this ingredient has the highest level of stated avoidance in the region. Latin American respondents exceed the global average for avoiding saturated fat (53% versus 42%) and carbohydrates (30% versus 25%). European respondents are more likely than the global average to say they avoid foods that contain antibiotics (65% versus 59%) and genetically modified organisms (59% versus 54%), while Africa/Middle East respondents exceed the global average for saying they avoid gluten (32% versus 26%), carbohydrates (30% versus 25%) and unsaturated fats (25% versus 18%).“Even within markets, health and wellness is not a one-size-fitsall approach,” said Mandzy. “Therefore, a focused approach is needed, with retailers and manufacturers identifying high-potential segments and the drivers of engagement for these consumers and then tailoring their messages and products accordingly.”AVOIDING ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS TOPS THE GLOBAL LISTGLOBAL AVERAGE: PERCENTAGE WHO SAY THEY TRY TO AVOID SPECIFIED INGREDIENT OR ATTRIBUTE  ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS ARTIFICIAL PRESERVATIVESARTIFICIAL COLORSANTIBIOTICS OR HORMONES USED IN ANIMAL PRODUCTSFOOD IN A PACKAGE WITH BPAGMOs ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS MSGSATURATED OR TRANS FATS SODIUMSUGAR NATURAL SWEETENERS GLUTEN CARBOHYDRATES BEEF & RED MEATUNSATURATED FATSLACTOSE/DAIRYPOULTRY FISH AND SEAFOODGRAINS EGGS62% 62% 61%59% 55%54%53% 49%42%41% 34%28% 26% 25%20% 18%15% 15% 15%12% 12%                    Source: The Nielsen Global Health and Ingredient- Sentiment Survey, Q1 2016  10 GLOBAL INGREDIENT AND OUT-OF-HOME DINING TRENDS REPORT

    Why are respondents avoiding these ingredients? Primarily becauseof their perceived impact on health, rather than because of an actual medical condition. Among those who say they avoid specific ingredients, roughly eight in 10 global respondents say they do so because they believe these ingredients are harmful to their own or their family’s health. The percentages who give this reason are fairly steady across categories: Artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners (84%, 84%, 84% and 78%, respectively); BPA (82%); GMOs (81%); antibiotics (81%); and MSG (79%).Respondents say they’re looking for simpler options and avoiding artificial ingredients and undesirable additives, but are actual purchases consistent with what respondents say?Nielsen retail sales data from Germany and the U.S. suggests that consumers are indeed backing up their sentiments with their wallets.In Germany, volume sales of organic products grew 10.6% over the 52 weeks ended April 3, 2016.6 In the U.S., volume sales of products with an organic claim on the package grew 13.1% over the 52 weeks ended July 30, 2016. In addition, products with claims that they are hormone- or antibiotic-free, GMO-free or natural grew 21.7%, 12.0% and 7.5%, respectively, over the same period. Claims that the product was made without artificial colors or flavors, high-fructose corn syrup or MSG also grew compared to the previous year, with volume sales of such products growing 5.4%, 3.2% and 2.3%, respectively, year over year.6Volume sales data are equivalized for Germany. That is, unit sales were converted to a common measure (kilograms) to control for differences in package size. In the U.S., volume is in terms of units.Source: Nielsen Wellness Track. 52 weeks ended in July 30, 2016 IN THE U.S., VOLUME SALES OF PRODUCTS WITHAN ORGANIC CLAIM ON THE PACKAGEGREW 13.1% 12 GLOBAL INGREDIENT AND OUT-OF-HOME DINING TRENDS REPORT 
 SEEKINGSIMPLICITY:LESS IS MOREDespite the inherent differences between markets, simplicity resonates globally. Three-quarters of global respondents (75%) strongly or somewhat agree that they’re concerned about the long- term health impact of artificial ingredients, with the highest levelof agreement in Asia-Pacific (80%). In addition, 69% strongly or somewhat agree that foods without artificial ingredients are always more healthful, and just over half (52%) agree that foods and beverages with fewer ingredients are more healthful, with agreement even stronger in North America (61%).Many consumers define healthful foods primarily by what they don’t contain, rather than the benefits they provide. Sixty-two percent of global respondents agree that the absence of undesirable ingredients is more important than the inclusion of beneficial ones. Once again, Asia-Pacific leads the way, with 70% of respondents saying they strongly or somewhat agree with this statement.“Informed and savvy consumers are demanding more from the foods they eat, and some are prioritizing ingredients over brands,” said Mandzy. “To many consumers, simple is beautiful, and foods with a short list of recognizable ingredients resonate strongly. Savvy manufacturers are responding to this trend by modifying product portfolios by simplifying food ingredient lists and creating natural and organic alternatives to existing offerings. Meanwhile, retailers are also prioritizing healthful foods and better-for-you brands in the center of the store, and emphasizing fresh and perishable foods around the perimeter in order to drive growth.”   Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 13

 HUNGRY FORHEALTHFUL: FOODTO FIT DIETARYNEEDS“Build it and they will come,” a quote made famous in the American movie “Field of Dreams,” is perhaps fitting when it comes to food availability. Among respondents who say they have a food sensitivity or limitation, fewer than half (45%) say their needs are being fully met by current product offerings, with even lower satisfaction levels in Latin America and Africa/Middle East. Fewer than four in 10 respondents in both regions say their needs are fully being met (37% each). Satisfaction levels are highest in North America, where 59% say their dietary needs are being fully met by current offerings, likely a reflection of the ample product selection and large store sizes in the region.“As awareness and diagnosis of food sensitivities rise worldwide and more consumers opt to change their diets, a new set of dietary needs with strong potential for growth is emerging,” said Mandzy. “Thereis clearly a gap, however, between the products many consumersare looking for and those that are currently available. Marketersthat prioritize unmet needs by way of new-product development, enhancement initiatives and assortment decisions will not only realize a boost to their bottom lines, but will also build a loyal shopper base that will drive sales well into the future.”  FEWER THAN HALF (45%)OF RESPONDENTS WHO SAY THEY HAVE A FOOD SENSITIVITY OR LIMITATION SAY THEIR NEEDS ARE BEING FULLY MET BY CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS        Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 15

 GREEN MEANS GO:WHAT HEALTH-CONSCIOUSCONSUMERS WANTThe opportunity to better serve consumers goes beyond those withfood sensitivities or limitations. It also applies to those looking tolead a more healthful lifestyle in general. Where do consumers see the biggest gap between the kinds of products they want and those currently available? Which items do they wish were on more stores’ shelves?Sentiment varies by region. The percentage of Latin American respondents who wish there were more products available exceedsthe global average for nearly all attributes surveyed. In contrast,North America trails the global averages for nearly all attributes. Not coincidentally, North Americans, who are the most likely to say their dietary needs are being fully met, are also the most likely to say they don’t see the need for any new products (18% versus 8% globally). Once again, this is likely a reflection of the larger-than-average store sizes and assortment options that are common in North America.European respondents are more likely than the global average to say they wish there were more products without artificial colors (51% versus 45%), artificial flavors (50% versus 43%) or GMOs (46% versus 38%), while Asia-Pacific has the highest percentage of respondents who say they want more organic products (51% versus 44% globally).  GLOBALLY, ALL-NATURAL PRODUCTS LEAD THE WAY IN POPULARITY58%OF GLOBAL RESPONDENTS WANT MORE ALL- NATURAL PRODUCTS   NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS 45% ORGANIC OPTIONS 44% NO ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS 43% REDUCED SUGAR 42% REDUCED FAT 42%                  Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 17
 WHAT TO DO NEXT:TAKEAWAYS FORRETAILERS ANDMANUFACTURERSThe health-and-wellness space has huge upside potential as consumers search for better, more healthful solutions that are compatible with their lifestyles and needs. Realizing the full potential will require collaboration between manufacturers and retailers, but there are some important strategies each party should keep in mind when navigating the health-and-wellness space.SUCCESS STRATEGIES FOR MANUFACTURERS• Keep it simple. It’s been said, but it bears repeating: Simple is in, and manufacturers should review their product portfolios for opportunities to remove or replace undesirable ingredients, particularly those seen as most objectionable, including artificial colors, flavors, preservatives and sweeteners; antibiotics; GMOs; and packaging made with BPA. Manufacturers that have taken these steps should highlight them prominently in their marketing campaigns. In addition, they should look for opportunities to leverage powerful brand names through line extensions, creating organic and natural alternatives to their existing product lines.• Innovate, invest, acquire. While removing undesirable ingredients is a good starting point, health-and-wellness strategies shouldn’t just be centered on that alone. New-product development remains critical, andit can encompass everything from creating a new version of traditional favorites using alternative ingredients (e.g., gluten-free bread or nondairy milk) to creating products with an entirely new taste experience. But savvy manufacturers aren’t going it alone when it comes to product development. Some have started venture capital funds to identify up-and- coming brands, while others are acquiring disruptive brands with strong growth potential.• Make it convenient, cost effective and tasty. While many consumers aspire to more healthful living, meeting this goal can prove quite challenging. Cost, taste and convenience are still very important in purchase decisions. Manufacturers should look for opportunities to combine these attributes, helping time-crunched consumers eat healthfully without sacrificing taste or breaking the bank.• Don’t ignore indulgence categories. Consumers still want to indulge,but they want to do it smartly. When looking for growth opportunities, manufacturers should think beyond traditionally healthful categories, instead looking for ways to make the indulgences consumers enjoy a little less sinful.  18 GLOBAL INGREDIENT AND OUT-OF-HOME DINING TRENDS REPORT
 SUCCESS STRATEGIES FOR RETAILERS• Realize that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Savvy retailers aren’t focused on a single category or a single department; they recognize that health and wellness matters across the entire store, and they carry an array of healthful options across categories and departments because they know that sales in one category (e.g., organic bread) can drive the sale of related products (e.g., natural peanut butter).• Consider offering related services. With greater competition in the health-and-wellness space, it’s increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd. One way retailers can differentiate themselves is to be a one-stop shop for all of consumers’ health needs. Retailers should look for opportunities to expand their in-store health care offerings, such as a clinic or pharmacy.• Employ experts. While consumers have access to more health- related information than ever before, sorting through it and deciding what’s accurate and what isn’t can be daunting. Retailers shouldbe seen as a partner in living more healthfully, and they should provide the resources to help consumers make the best choices for themselves. Some retailers have rolled out shelf tags that designate more healthful choices, but to truly stand out, retailers should train associates to be more knowledgeable about healthful products, and they should consider employing experts, such as dietitians, who can help shoppers make smarter decisions.• Focus on ailment sufferers and older consumers. Nielsen U.S.sales data shows that households with an ailment sufferer (anyone coping with a health problem, including allergies, obesity, and insomnia) spend disproportionately more on health and personal- care products. In addition, older respondents account for a majority of over-the-counter medication sales. Therefore, it’s critical to understand how these consumers shop across the store in order to develop strategies to market to them and optimize assortment.  Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 19

 SHOULD I STAY, OR SHOULD I GO (OUT)?AROUND THE WORLD• Global respondents are avid out-of-home diners, with nearly half (48%) saying they eat out weekly or more often.• Lunch and dinner are the meals that consumers most frequently eat away from home, but breakfast may represent a growth opportunity in some markets.• Quick-service and casual restaurants are the most preferred eating establishments.• Food quality and price are the most important factors when choosing an out-of- home dining establishment.Consumers aren’t just eating at home. They’re also dining out—many quite frequently—and the establishments serving them compete with food retailers and manufacturers in the battle for consumers’ wallets.The Nielsen Global Out-of-Home Dining Survey polled more than 30,000 online respondents in 61 countries to understand consumers’ out-of-home dining behaviors and preferences. We examined respondents’ self-reported frequency of eating out, their preferred dining establishments and the most important selection factors when choosing a restaurant. We also offer insight into how retailers can protect their share of food spending.Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 21
 STRONG APPETITESFOR OUT-OF-HOMEDININGEating out isn’t just for special occasions; it’s a way of life for nearly half of global respondents (48%), who say they eat at restaurants or other out-of-home dining establishments weekly or more often. Respondents in Asia-Pacific and North America are particularly avid out-of-home diners.FEEDING FRENZYFREQUENCY OF DINING AT RESTURANTS OR OTHER OUT-OF-HOME DINING ESTABLISHMENTSASIA-PACIFIC10% 10%20% 28%EUROPE       32%4%5% 14%42%36%AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST24% 10% 12%34% 20%LATIN AMERICA23% 11%37%       NORTH AMERICA13% 11% 16%30%31%9% 21%    ONCE A DAY OR MORE FREQUENTLYONCE OR TWICE A WEEK 1-3 TIMES PER MONTH LESS THAN ONCE A MONTH OR NEVERSource: The Nielsen Global Out-of-Home Dining Survey, Q3 2015 Note: Percentages may not equal 100% due to rounding3 TO 6 TIMES A WEEK      DAILY DINERS9%OF GLOBAL RESPONDENTS SAY THEY EAT AWAY FROM HOME ONCE A DAY OR MORE FREQUENTLY.HONG KONG 26% TAIWAN 25% MALAYSIA 23% THAILAND 22% MOROCCO 20% SINGAPORE 19% BRAZIL 17% VIETNAM 16% SAUDI ARABIA 15% INDIA 14% UNITED STATES 12% EGYPT 12% INDONESIA 11%    COUNTRIES THAT EXCEED THE GLOBAL AVERAGESource: The Nielsen Global Out-of-Home Dining Survey, Q3 2015  22 GLOBAL INGREDIENT AND OUT-OF-HOME DINING TRENDS REPORT
RISE AND SHINERS,NOT RISE ANDDINERSDinner and lunch are the meals that respondents most commonlyeat away from home, while fewer say they eat breakfast outside the home. But this trend may be changing in some markets. For example, respondents in the U.S. are more likely than the global average to say they eat breakfast at an out-of-home dining establishment (21% versus 16% globally), and many restaurants are capitalizing on the breakfast trend by introducing convenient offerings for busy consumers who have little time for a formal meal. Coffee shops are expanding their menus to include more breakfast options, while some quick-service restaurants have introduced breakfast service or made their breakfast offerings available all day.“Breakfast has been a growth driver for some fast-food and quick-servicedining establishments, but it represents a strong growth opportunityfor retailers as well,” said Mandzy. “To win at breakfast, retailers shouldfocus on healthfulness and convenience. Consumers often have lesstime for meal planning and preparation in the morning, but quality, tasteand freshness remain critical. And products that pack a healthful benefitare even better positioned to succeed. For example, while the ready-to- eat cereals category is declining in the U.S., the gluten-free, GMO-free and no-high-fructose-corn-syrup cereal sub-segments are growing.”LUNCH AND DINNER ARE FAVORITE FARESPERCENTAGE OF OUT-OF-HOME DINERS WHO SAY THEY EAT SPECIFIED MEAL AWAY FROM HOMELATIN AMERICA   63% 53%16%GLOBALBREAKFAST66% 61% 52% 52%LUNCH51%57% 16%DINNER65% 69%51%            18%ASIA- PACIFIC9%EUROPE45%21% 13%       Base: All those who eat out at restaurants or other out-of-home dining establishments Source: The Nielsen Global Out-of-Home Dining Survey, Q3 2015EASTLATIN NORTHAFRICA/MIDDLE AMERICA AMERICA    LATIN AMERICAN LUNCHERS53%OF GLOBAL RESPONDENTS WHO SAY THEY DINE OUT, EAT LUNCH AWAY FROM HOME.THREE OF THE TOP FIVE COUNTRIES WITH THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF RESPONDENTS WHO EAT LUNCH AWAY FROM HOME ARE IN LATIN AMERICA.POLAND 80%SLOVAKIA 78% MOROCCO 74%CZECH REPUBLIC 71% LATVIA 71% LITHUANIA 70% SLOVENIA 70%HUNGARY 68% HONG KONG 67% TAIWAN 65% FRANCE 65% JAPAN 64% ESTONIA 64%EGYPT 63% SPAIN 61%Source: The Nielsen Global Out-of-Home Dining Survey, Q3 2015  TOP 20 COUNTRIES THAT DINE OUT FOR LUNCH  CHILE 79%        BRAZIL 72% COLOMBIA 72%      PERU   70%      VENEZUELA 64%      Copyright © 2016 The Nielsen Company 23

 FOOD FIGHT: WINNING THE BATTLE FOR SHARE OF STOMACHSMany retailers have rolled out competitively priced ready-to-eat foods to compete with out-of-home dining establishments. How can retailers stave off the competition and protect—and even grow—their share?• Get the product mix right. Some retailers can offer a breadth of cuisine types—from sandwiches to sushi—that allows consumers to select the option that best suits taste buds. But not all retailers can or should provide such a broad array. For some, it may be sufficient to offer consumers an easier, more upscale alternative to what they can make at home. Retailers should assess space and supply chain considerations as well as consumer expectations, when determining the best model.• Prioritize speed. For some consumers, much of the appeal of prepared meals in stores is the ability to quickly pick up dinner while purchasing other items—perhaps grabbing a gallon of milk for breakfast the next morning. But for consumers who are just looking for a quick meal, retailers should prioritize speed and make it easy for consumers to getin and out quickly. For example, consider positioning prepared mealsor food-service counters on the perimeter near the front of the store, or provide separate checkout stations so customers can skip the longer lines in the main checkout area.• Emphasize health and be transparent. Busy consumers want the speedof quick-service restaurants, but they also want fresher, more healthful options. Retailers should consider expanding their array of better-for-you options, including those for consumers with special dietary needs. They should also look for opportunities to remove, reduce or replace undesirable ingredients in their prepared foods, and they should prominently tout these benefits with in-store signage. Also, as consumers demand more transparency about the foods they eat, retailers should provide nutritional information for prepared foods to help consumers to make more healthful and better-informed choices.• Think beyond ready-to-eat. Some consumers may be pressed for time but still enjoy cooking or desire more control over the ingredients that go into their meals, while others may need quick solutions but don’t wanta ready-to-eat meal that may be less tasty after it has been sitting for a few days. Whatever the reason, some consumers may prefer other quick- meal solutions beyond fully prepared meals. Retailers should look for opportunities to better serve these consumers, such as offering meal kits that contain premeasured portions of all of the ingredients respondents need to prepare a quick meal at home.  26 GLOBAL INGREDIENT AND OUT-OF-HOME DINING TRENDS REPORT

   ABOUT THE NIELSEN GLOBAL SURVEYThe Nielsen Global Health and Ingredient-Sentiment Survey was conducted March 1-23, 2016, and polled online consumers in 63 countries, while the Nielsen Global Out-of-Home Dining Survey was conducted Aug. 10–Sept. 4, 2015, and polled consumers in 61 countries. Both surveys polled more than 30,000 respondents throughout Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East/Africa and North America. The sample for both surveys includes internet users who agreed to participate in this survey and has quotas based on age and sex for each country. It is weighted to be representative of internet consumers by country. Because the sample is based on those who agreedto participate, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.
